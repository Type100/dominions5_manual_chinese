After finishing Dominions 4 and making quite a few patches too we once again got a bit tired of working on Dominions. When thinking about what kind of game we wanted to work on, we decided it had to be something different and we began to work on a space game. It was going to be a game where you mined and transported minerals in order to build space ships to defeat your enemies with. It was inspired by the good old vga-planets game.
The game got random planets and some nice mineral surveys, but it never got far before we abandoned it in favor of a new version of Conquest of Elysium. We had some good ideas for CoE like an inferno plane that contained the demon lords and if you summoned them they would actually be summoned from that plane. It would then be possible (just) to kill them permanently by going down there and slaying them on their home plane. We also had ideas for random rituals, inaccurate monster descriptions and new combat mechanics. After about one and a half years and many additional planes, Conquest of Elysium 4 was released.
After CoE4 we started to play and develop Trade and Taint again just for the fun of it. It is a game that we did not intend to finish, so we could play and experiment as much as we liked.
After a while we wanted to make a game we could finish again, but we wanted it to be something different from CoE and Dominions. We have played many roguelike games back in the times, and recently we had played Tales of Majâ€™Eyal too and we had many ideas on how to make a better roguelike. So we started to make our own roguelike game called Dungeons of Elysium. It had the same aggressive wildlife that can be found in Elysium. It also took advantage of the terrain drawing engine in Elysium that turned out to be really good at drawing dungeons too.
DoE had a similar class system to TaT where you start on a random career e.g. a footpad and then the footpad can advance to smuggler, burglar or grave robber depending on what trainer you encounter.
We created a few stories, a fun abstract travel system, and a dungeon editor. Actually, the dungeon editor turned out to be very useful at creating nice looking encounter maps for our own pen and paper role playing campaigns. After canceling DoE we later made the map editor a bit more user-friendly and released it as Illwinter's Floorplan Generator, a tool to help pen and paper role-players.
After a few months of DoE we also started to work on our old 4x space strategy game again. The planets and minerals were already in place, so this time we added production, space combat and ground combat. Combat was automatic like in Dominions, but more colorful with lasers and photon torpedoes in space.
Production was a bit different from most other games, you had to create factories for specific spaceship models in order to produce it efficiently. So you were encouraged to not redesign your spaceship models too frequently as you would have to build new factories for them as well.
By now many years had passed since we released Dominions 4 and we felt inspired to do a Dominions 5. Realtime combat was going to be the major change for the new Dominions, but we had a quite a few other ideas too. One idea that didn't make it was The Council of Immortals, where you got to vote for divine laws and titles and got influence from your claimed thrones. Another idea was for mounts to have separate stats, so you could kill either the mount or the rider. Kristoffer had ideas for a ton of new nations as usual, some of them made it into Dominions 5 and hopefully a few more will make it in future updates to the game.
When the development of Dominions 5 started we imported the GUI system from CoE4 that gets rid of the fuzzy looking font and the 3D engine was updated to use the one from Trade and Taint. After many years of incremental updates the 3D world in Trade and Taint was both faster and better looking than the one in Dominions 4, so it would be stupid not to use that one instead. At first we also used the particle effects on magic items that we had in TaT and that made the items sparkle or burn with blue flames. But it didn't feel right in Dominions and it was removed.
When writing this the 3D castles are still not finished, some units of Rus only looks like a few red letters and many descriptions remain to be written. But the game plays well and it feels realistic that it will be finished in a month when it is supposed to be released.
We hope you will enjoy the game! /Johan & Kristoffer, October 2017
