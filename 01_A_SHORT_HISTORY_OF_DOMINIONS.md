The world of Dominions took its first insecure steps in 1997 on the road to Santiago de Compostela. We had finished Conquest of Elysium, a simple yet addictive fantasy game with a great deal of Nethack-ish unfairness and a multitude of monsters (a trademark of ours). We were working on a space empire game, but decided that Master of Orion 2 had much of what we liked in such a game, so we quit that project. Then I went to France and Spain for the summer for a 1,000-mile walk. It took 72 days and I had a lot of thinking to do. Several ideas came up, including a bug war with ants, wasps and other bugs armed with cybernetics and guns. Some ideas from earlier in the spring evolved, and rudiments of Pythium, C'tis, Man and Lareaux (a conglomerate of Ulm and Marignon) came to life. 
When I returned from Santiago, we began working on the bug wars, but soon got bored and decided to make a tactical fantasy game where you bought an army and pitted it against your opponent’s army. 
Statistics, battle mechanics, and morale are from this era. The tactical engine was much based upon board games where commanders give orders to squads. SPQR, Age of Chivalry and Warhammer Fantasy Battle were inspirational sources. Morale loss and rout is a feature in all of these. At first you monitored every single unit, but soon you only moved your commanders and told them what orders to give to what squads. 
WFB gave us the idea that heroes are fun, but we didn't want heroes to be as important as they are in WFB. At that time there were no magic items, spells or monsters, apart from the hydra. 
After a while, fighting was becoming boring, and if the output is boring, you quit. At this time we were inspired by VGA-Planets and decided that we wanted a strategic PBEM game with tactical battles. We started to think about how to place the tactical engine in a strategic game and still have a game that was playable by mail. Control over battles was the solution. 
The move from a purely tactical to a strategic game made the world much more important. Some earlier ideas of an Ars Magica-like game of magical research and politics were remade. Random content and magical sites in the provinces would increase replayability. Mages of the Order of Hermes were replaced by competing gods. The magical and divine auras of Ars Magica gave us the idea of a dual war of armies and dominions. Mythological and historical paraphrases came naturally as I have a great interest in the history of religions. 
Several nations had been thought up in the process of making the tactical engine, but they evolved and changed over time. Pythium was split into Pythium and Arcoscephale; Lareaux into Ulm and Marignon. 
Magic and research were incorporated in the game. The eight paths and several dozen spells were there from the beginning, but research was strange and boring. The idea of the magic schools made research an important choice, not just a matter of how rich you were. Global enchantments were a later add-on inspired by Ars Magica and Master of Magic. 
Since 1997 the game has undergone many changes, but some things are as they were in the beginning. We still have old papers from 1997 that tells us how many resources a plate cuirass costs, and what a mage should cost at a given skill level. Even though we scribbled down new stats as the numbers were altered, the papers remained the same, until work began on Dominions 3 in 2004 and we remade the armor protection mechanics. 
Dominions: Priests, Prophets and Pretenders was released 2001. It got some Usenet attention and we were glad to get some input. Bugs and imperfections were pointed out and we tried to fix most of them. After a half year or so we decided that we wanted to make a new game instead of making small changes to Dominions. 
We started on several ideas, including a strange 3D version of Dominions. After a while we returned to Dominions and decided to make what is now Dominions II. Our primary goal was to remake the user interface. Much was the same, but many ideas that were difficult to incorporate into Dominions: PPP were now possible to implement. We had as much time as we wished, no schedule, and no expectations. 
During Christmas 2001 I visited my parents and had some spare days. I accidentally made a board game map and system inspired by Dominions, but never managed to finish it. I still have a bunch of papers, a wooden map, and a little box filled with some hundred wood pieces that needs painting. Johan Karlsson (the programmer and co-designer) is more of a finisher than I am. We later scanned the map and used it as our first Dominions II map (The Sundering). 
Dominions II was released, and we started working on the first patch. The first patch included new themes as well lots of small changes and bugfixes. The game and the community grew and we got positive feedback and inspiration from fans all over the world. Maps, mods and other contributions made by fans kept the community―as well as us―active. 
New content was added in a number of patches. We still had many ideas regarding the world, the game, and the future. At first, we were content with patching the game, but after a while we decided that there were things that could not be fixed unless major changes were made to the game engine. We decided to start on a third version of Dominions. 
I had plenty of ideas regarding nations and themes. The first was Oceania, an underwater nation similar to Pangaea. An early version of Oceania was included in one of the last patches for Dominions II. Sauromatia, inspired by the Scythians, Amazons and Androphags of Herodotus, and Bandar Log, a nation inspired by ancient India and Hindu myth, were two nations I had been dreaming about. Soon, the numbers of nations increased and we decided to divided the nations chronologically and alter the theme structure. Themes were replaced by three ages with somewhat different characteristics. The concept of Awakening, an old idea, was relaunched. 
Then work slowed down for a while. Work, social life and other computer games ate up part of our time. We didn't have a deadline, nor any clear direction, apart from adding fun stuff and making the game more user-friendly. After a rather long period of random adding of content and bug fixes, we decided that it was time to start the beta. In February 2006, the Dominions 3 beta forum was started, and almost 7,000 posts later, Dominions 3 – The Awakening was finished. 
That’s about it, I think.
