If the combat system is the heart of Dominions 5, the magic system is the soul. Everything is affected by magic in some way. The most powerful spells can summon awesome monsters or change the face of the entire world. Magic can also be used to craft artifacts for use by heroes. Some basic points to remember are:
● Spells are either rituals, which are cast outside of combat, or battle magic, which is used in tactical battles
● Magic depends both on the path and the school of magic
● The path skill of a given mage is generally fixed and doesn’t change easily
● School is a group of spells which can be learned through research
● Research is performed in laboratories
● Magic gems and blood slaves are needed for many spells
● These gems are produced by magic sites, including those in a nation’s home province
● Gems and blood slaves are items which can be carried by commanders or stored in a nation’s pool ● Laboratories also provide access to a nation’s pool of magic gems, blood slaves and items
● The Construction school allows for the building of magical items and artifacts
● There are also Divine spells, which are special battle magic spells that can be cast by priests
The Paths of Magical Power
There are eight paths of magical power:   Fire,   Air,   Water,   Earth,   Astral, Nature,
Death, and   Blood. There are seven types of magical gems which correspond to the first seven of these paths. There are no Blood gems – Blood magic requires blood slaves, which can only be obtained through blood hunting. The symbols shown are used to represent magic paths, and will appear in spell descriptions as requirements for casting the spell.
Paths define the essential branches of magic. A fire mage can eventually learn all of the Fire spells in all the schools of magic for which he has the requisite magical ability, once his nation has researched them. But he cannot learn Nature or Earth spells, for instance, unless he first gains the path skill. While there are magic items that can increase a mage’s skill level in paths he already possesses, a mage can only acquire new paths through Empowerment (see below).
The Schools of Magical Research
There are also seven schools of magical research: Conjuration, Alteration, Evocation, Construction, Enchantment, Thaumaturgy, and Blood Magic. Note that the school of Blood Magic is not the same as the path of Blood Magic (although the two are related).
Schools define the areas of study needed to master the spells within each path of magic. For example, Conjuration is the school of magic that deals largely with summoning creatures from outside the world. Any nation can research the Conjuration school, and its mages would be able to use any spell in that school a) up to the current research level, and b) which required a magic path those mages possessed.
In order for a mage to cast a spell (a) you must have researched the school up to the level required by the spell, and (b) the mage must have proficiency in the magical path(s) required by a spell, and (c) the mage must have any magical gems or blood slaves required for the spell..
While each school has many different spells, the general characteristics of each school are as follows.
Conjuration: Summons powers and beings from other worlds. Many spells in this school will bring you additional units.
Alteration: Changes the physical world. Alteration spells can give units increased strength, resistance to fire, and the like. They can also change the weather.
Evocation: Projects arcane power into the physical world. If you want to cast spells that are traditionally associated with magic, like fireballs and lightning bolts, this is the school for you. Lots of battle magic.
Construction: The level of your construction research determines which magic items you are allowed to craft. Some construction spells also allow you to make magic units.
Enchantment: Grants magical properties to men, items or the land. You can cover entire provinces with protective domes, or grant long-lasting increased health to your subjects.
Thaumaturgy: Manipulates the arcane world in ways traditionally associated with sorcery. You might call forth the souls of victims a soldier has killed and send them after him, or create a window in space to observe distant lands.
Blood Magic: All spells that use blood magic have to be unlocked by researching this school. If your nation has any blood mages, you will want to do some research here.
Refer to the spell charts in the Appendix for a thumbnail description of each spell in the game.
Access to Magic Spells
Each spell has a path requirement, listed as a number of symbols. In order to cast a spell, a mage must meet all the path requirements for the spell, and his nation must have researched to the appropriate level in the school which contains the spell in question.
Spells that are a higher level in a school don’t necessarily require more path skill to cast: Will o’ the Wisp is a level 5 Conjuration spell, but only requires Fire-1. This is one reason it is important to become familiar with which spells exist in which school, so you can plan your research.
Note that while the schools generally categorize spells, they don’t do so rigorously – Acashic Knowledge is a Conjuration spell which has nothing to do with summoning. Instead, it searches provinces for sources of magic gems.
Combined Paths
Some spells require knowledge of multiple paths to cast them. A spell with multiple paths in its requirements necessitates that the mage have the requisite level in each path to cast the spell. When calculating bonuses for extra skill levels (see Fatigue below) only the first magic path listed in the skill description is considered. Dual path spells and rituals use magic gems of the primary path.
Empowerment
A mage may permanently increase his skill in any path of magic by using Empowerment. This costs a lot of magic gems. For the first skill level in that magic path, the cost is 50 magic gems of that type. For subsequent increases the cost depends on the current skill in the magic path and is 15 x [target level]. This is the only way to gain skill in a path a unit doesn’t have. Magic items which increase magic skill only work if the user’s skill in that path is at least 1. This is also true of battlefield spells which confer a path bonus, like Power of the Spheres.
Indirect Magic
Indirect magic represents the general arcane knowledge that a mage possesses about any magic path in which he has skill. This knowledge allows him to gain side benefits just from being knowledgeable in that type of magic. The more skill a mage has in a path, the more benefit he gains.
Indirect magic bonuses for resistances and protection have minimum a minimum skill level requirement of 3 to confer the bonuses listed. For resistances, the unit gains +5 of the specified resistance at level 3, and 2 per level above 3. For protection, the unit gains +3 protection at level 3, and 1 per level above 3.
    Path
 Powers per skill level
     Air Shock Resistance, Magic Leadership +5
   Astral Magic Leadership +10
   Death Undead Leadership +30, +1 to existing Fear
   Earth Protection, Magic Leadership +5
   Fire Resistance, Leadership +5, Magic Fire Leadership +5
   Supply Bonus +10, Magic Leadership +5, Nature Poison Resistance, Supply Bonus +10
   Water Cold Resistance, Magic Leadership +5
   Blood Undead Leadership +5, Magic Leadership +5
 The +1 to Fear for each Death level applies to an existing Fear ability. Mages with no pre-existing Fear gain Fear +5 at Death skill 5. Lesser levels of Death magic do not confer any level of Fear.
     Example: You are playing Asphodel, Carrion Woods and select a Freak Lord pretender. You take advantage of the 10-point cost for new paths and choose Fire 2, Air 2, Water 3, Earth 4, and Blood 1. Your pretender will gain +10 Leadership and +10 Magic Leadership (for Fire 2), +10 Magic Leadership (for Air 2), +5 Cold Resistance and +15 Magic Leadership (for Water 3), +4 Protection and +20 Magic Leadership (for Earth 4) and +5 Undead Leadership and +5 Magic Leadership for Blood 1. Note that the pretender does not gain Shock Resistance or Fire Resistance because neither of those paths (Air and Fire) meet the resistance requirement of skill 3 in that path.
Notice that if you add up all the leadership bonuses, this Freak Lord has +10 Leadership, +5 Undead Leadership, and +60 Magic Leadership. What a freak!
                     Indirect magic apply all units with any magic skill, including pretenders, within the level activation requirements described above.
TYPES OF SPELLS
Spells are divided into two basic categories: Rituals and Battle Magic. The spell lists in the Appendix are divided in this way.
Battle Magic
Battle magic can only be cast during a tactical battle. These spells have battle effects like inflicting damage, granting increased protection, reducing fatigue, or some similar effect which only makes sense in the context of the battle mechanics. Battle magic can be scripted into a mage’s list of battle actions using Set battle orders. If a battle spell requires gems, that mage must have those gems in his inventory before the battle begins.
Some battle spells affect the whole battlefield and are termed battle enchantments. Some of these last the length of the battle. A battle enchantment is dispelled if its caster dies.
Interrupts Spells have to be prepared for a while before they can be cast. During this preparation time, the caster can be interrupted if he is damaged. The preparation time is about half of the time required to cast the spell. The other half of the time is spent recovering after the spell has been cast. The casting time for most spells is one combat round, but battle enchantments and spells that cost magic gems often take longer.
The chance of being interrupted when damaged while casting a spell is expressed as a percentage of your full hit points caused by the damage, plus 25%. Thus, a strike that inflicted half of a spell caster’s full hit points in damage would have a 75% chance of interrupting the spell being cast.
Units with the “combat caster” ability (such as the paladin) are half as likely to be interrupted as a normal unit. Mindless units are also half as likely to be interrupted as a normal unit would be.
Some monsters are innate spell casters. These monsters do not require any preparation time for their spells and do not care about different casting times.
Battle Magic mechanics The method for resolving battle magic is very similar to that for missile weapons. Mages have a Precision attribute just like archers do. Spells have a Precision rating, also. For the purposes of calculation these two are added together. Some spells (like Acid Bolt) are armor- piercing. This means Protection against them only counts for half, just like armor-piercing missiles. Some other spells (like Orb Lightning) are armor-negating. This means they completely bypass Protection, and the target’s only defense is the die roll.
In some cases, instead of Protection, though, some spells check a target’s Magic Resistance. It actually is protection. Protection from magic! Magic Resistance is most often binary in nature, it either protects the target or it does not, with nothing in-between. Against some spells a successful resistance check merely means crippling injuries rather than instant death.
Some spells (mostly Astral) require the caster to defeat the target’s Magic Resistance before the spell can take effect. If a spell description states that “Magic resistance negates” then the following check is made:
Caster’s Penetration roll: 10 + DRN + (additional skill in spell path) / 2 Target’s MR roll: Magic Resistance + DRN + (skill in spell path) / 2
The caster wins ties. Note that not all targets will have any magic skill, much less skill in that spell’s path, so often the target will simply add Magic Resistance and the DRN.
If a spell description states that “Magic resistance negates easily” then the caster suffers a –4 modifier to his or her penetration roll. This is the same as "easy to resist." "Hard to resist" gives a +4 to penetration roll.
Fatigue
Just like attacking in combat, casting spells in battle costs fatigue. Each spell has a listed fatigue cost which a caster incurs when casting that spell. For each skill level in the required path that the mage exceeds the minimum, he incurs 1 / (1 + (mage skill – minimum skill) of the listed spell fatigue. In other words, having an extra skill level means the mage suffers only 1⁄2 fatigue, two extra skill levels means he suffers only 1/3 as much, three extra is 1⁄4, and so forth.
Spell casters also incur fatigue equal to their base Encumbrance value + 2x Encumbrance value of any armor worn for each spell cast. This is not subject to reduction by skill bonuses. It is harder to make magical gestures in heavy armor. Everyone knows this from armor class days.
Fatigue is very important for spell casters. It is often the limiting factor in combat, and higher-skill mages thus have an advantage in that they incur less fatigue. Spells that reduce fatigue, like Reinvigoration or Relief, can be very useful as well.
Rituals
Rituals are spells which have an effect on the world map, and take an entire month (game turn) to cast. Thus, mages which are to cast a ritual have to be given that order as part of the turn. If a ritual requires gems, the mage may only use gems from a laboratory and rituals can only be cast in provinces with labs (assuming the national pool has enough gems of the required type). The gems will be withdrawn from the national inventory automatically.
Some rituals affect the entire province that they are cast in. Some of these (but not all) last longer than one turn. These are termed local enchantments. An example of such a spell is Dome of Air. Once the Dome of Air is cast, it persists in that province until dispelled. The spell is dispelled if the caster dies. Local enchantments are also dispelled if the province they affect is conquered by an enemy. The exception to that is that local enchantment powered by Blood magic will persist even if the province is conquered. They must be dispelled instead.
Rituals can be automated to be recast each month by the same mage using the [Shift]+[m] shortcut when selected and in a laboratory province. The mage will cast the spell as long as he has enough gems.
If you try to cast a spell and it doesn’t get cast, the most likely problem is that you don’t have enough gems of the correct type.
Global Enchantments
Global enchantments are rituals. These are very powerful spells that affect the entire world of Dominions 5. They often cost a lot of gems and have severe effects. Only five such spells can be in effect at any one time. You can find out which global enchantments are in effect at any point of a game by clicking on the Global Enchantments button in the main screen, or just hitting [F6].
When casting a global enchantment, you have the option of adding more gems to the spell than are required. This is because the more gems you use to cast a spell, the harder it is to dispel it.
The maximum number of gems a mage can use to cast a ritual is his or her path level x 100. So a skillful mage casting a simple global enchantment can put very many extra gems into it if he or she wants.
Just like local enchantments, global enchantments are dependent on their caster. If the caster dies, the global is dispelled. This can be because he died of old age, or because some clever enemy realized it was easier to assassinate him than to try to dispel the massive global spell he had put 200 extra gems into. Extra gems don’t protect mages against assassination.
Dispelling global enchantments Global enchantments can be dispelled in one of two ways. The first is with an Enchantment-5 spell that is Astral-3 (that’s a spell that requires a skill of 3 in the Astral path, and is level 5 in the Enchantment school of magic) simply called Dispel. The other way is to cast another global enchantment when there are five already active. The sixth one will replace one of the five existing ones if it is successful in overcoming it. The enchantment it will attempt to replace is random, so casting a global enchantment to dispel a specific enemy global is unlikely to select exactly that spell. However, it’s better than nothing.
The exception to this is if you try and cast a global enchantment that is already in effect by another nation. In this case, your version will try to replace the enemy version instead of trying to replace a random existing global.
To reiterate: when a global enchantment is cast, the following cases are applied in order:
● if there is already a global of the same name active, the new global attempts to replace it according to the dispel mechanics
● if there are fewer than five active spells and there is not already an instance of this spell active, the newly cast global immediately fills one of the empty slots
● if there are already five global spells active, the newly cast global attempts to replace a randomly chosen spell. This can be a spell cast by the same nation casting the new global. You can accidentally dispel your own spells. These are unruly magicks.
Spells cast by multiple mages are cast in a random order. This true for all mages, not just those of a given nation. What happens at any given time depends on how many global spells are active, and which ones they are. There may only be two globals active at the beginning of a turn, but by the time a mage casts his own, several other mages may have filled up the remaining slots.
Dispel mechanics Whenever Dispel is cast or a global tries to replace another for whatever reason, the two spells are compared. The total number of extra gems and the levels of the casters above their spells’ requirements are compared according to the following formula:
+1 for each extra gem (above the requirement for casting)
+5 for each level of skill by the casting mage in the spell’s path above the casting requirement
a drn (single open-ended die) is added to each side. The side with the higher number wins.
Communions
The Astral and Blood paths of magic contain a special type of spell called a communion that allows mages to increase their magic skill temporarily while in combat and to distribute the fatigue from their spellcasting among other friendly mages. It requires the casting of two spells, one being the master and the other being the slave. The Astral spells are called Communion Master and Communion slave, while the Blood spells are called Sabbath Master and Sabbath Slave, and function identically except for the name and the fact that the Astral Spell uses gems and the Blood spell uses blood slaves. For the purposes of this section they will simply be referred to as communions. A valid communion cannot exist without both the spells Communion Master and Communion Slave (or Sabbath Master and Sabbath Slave) in effect.
Communions give the communion master(s) +1 skill in all paths of magic in which they already have at least 1 skill. They also allow the fatigue from spellcasting to be distributed among all the communion slaves in that communion.
Level bonus: A communion master gains n extra levels in each of his or her known magic paths for every 2n slaves in the communion. This is true for each communion master in the communion.
Fatigue distribution: The amount of fatigue assigned to each participant in the communion is the cost of the spell cast by the master divided by the number of participants in the communion. This is further modified depending on the skill level of the communion slaves:
slave level = master level -> no modification slave level > master level -> fatigue / 2
slave level < master level / 2 -> fatigue * 4 slave level < master level -> fatigue * 2
Definition of participant: the communion master casting the spell in question, plus all friendly communion slaves on the battlefield, are considered participants in the communion for the purpose of any single spell cast. Note that skill levels gained from the communion (and all other means) are included when calculating fatigue cost of a spell.
The skill bonus gained by each master drops as soon as the number of slaves in the communion drops below the threshold for that bonus. The communion ends as soon as there are either no masters or no slaves in the communion.
Slaves cannot perform any actions on their own while part of the communion. However, they do benefit from any self-buffs cast by the communion master(s).
If the communion breaks because all the communion masters are dead or have fled the battlefield, the communion slaves suffer a backlash that affects all slaves by stunning them for approximately one round, and inflicts 3d50 fatigue damage per slave.
The magic items Crystal Matrix and Crystal Slave allow their bearers to participate automatically in a communion with having to cast the spell. The bearers must be mages (at least 1 skill in a magic path other than Holy). They do not, however, have to have Astral skill.
MAGIC GEMS
Gems represent the physical manifestation of the magical essence of the paths of arcane power. They are generated by magic sites, and the owner of the site has these gems added automatically to his magic resource treasury (accessible with the [F7] key) each turn, as long as there is a connection through friendly territory to a province with a laboratory.
Managing your magic resources
The magic resource treasury (shown below) lists all the gems your nation currently has, as well as the rate at which it is acquiring new ones. To the right, the “pool” button allows you to collect all gems from commanders stationed in a province with a laboratory. This is especially effective for blood hunters, who will often need to transfer slaves from their inventory to the national pool. Clicking the choice at the bottom of this screen opens a new window that allows you to transfer gems between commanders by clicking on the number of gems they have.
Using magic gems in combat
Mages can use magic gems in combat for two purposes: to temporarily raise their skill level, and to reduce fatigue. This represents the release of the distilled magical power of the gems themselves. Because it takes a skilled caster to keep things from getting out of control, a mage can only use as many gems as his current skill level in that path each turn.
By using a magic gem, a caster gains one skill level in that magic path. This can be used both to allow a mage to cast a spell for which he would not normally have the skill, or to reduce the fatigue of a spell, or both. However, a mage may never increase his skill level by more than one by using gems, or gain skill in a path in which he or she did not already have at least one skill level.
The player may script spells for which a mage does not have the requisite skill and place the necessary gems in his inventory. He may also simply include extra gems in the mages inventory and the computer will use them to reduce fatigue for spells he already has the skill for, if necessary. However, the specific use of gems in this manner is controlled by the computer. Checking the box “conservative gem use” will ensure that the mage uses his gems as sparingly as possible and for scripted spells only. This can be useful if you want to save gems for later battles. Otherwise there is no opportunity for the player to intervene.
Some spells increase a caster’s skill in a magic path for the duration of the combat. The difference between these spells, and using gems to increase magic skill, is that using gems only lasts for that one spell in that one combat round.
 RESEARCH
The research sliders in the Arcane Laboratory determine how many research points you have allocated to a school of magic in a given turn. The number of points available is equal to the total of the research abilities of all commanders given orders to research in that turn. In order to have research as an available command, that commander must be in a province with a friendly laboratory, because that is where the magic books are. Each mage can only research one school of magic in a turn, which is different from Dominions 4.
Normally only commanders with magic skill can conduct research. The number of research points is indicated next to the pile-of-magic-books symbol. The higher a mage’s magic skills, the more research points he or she will have. The only non-mages who can research are the philosophers of Arcoscephale and any units with the Divine Insights special ability. Commanders with Divine Insights contribute 3 research points but there can only be a number of them at work in a single lab equal to the dominion strength in the province. Any divinely inspired researchers over that limit do not contribute anything.
Magical research points are affected by Magic/Drain scales. Magic scales give mages extra vigor to study the tomes of arcana all night. Drain scales make them sleepy.
The basic formula for calculating a mage's research ability is: (5 + (2x magic levels of mage) +/- research bonus/penalty.
MAGIC ITEMS
The Construction school of magic allows you to construct magic items which can be given to commanders to use. This is done by giving the order “Forge Item” to a mage in a laboratory. He then uses whatever magic gems are required to create the item. Some items (artifacts) are unique, and only one of each can exist in the game at a time. The remainder of the magic items available for forging can be created without restriction, as long as creating nation has researched the appropriate level in the Construction school, and the crafting mage has the requisite skill and gems. A mage can be set to repeatedly forge the same item every turn by selecting him and using the key combination [shift] + [o].
DIVINE MAGIC
Divine spells are a special category of magic, which does not depend on research or magic paths. Instead, it depends on the Holy skill of the caster, and is thus only available to priests or other units with at least one level of Holy skill. All common divine spells are available to all nations at the start of the game, and units can cast all spells for which they have the appropriate skill level. All divine magic consists of battlefield spells.
ALCHEMY
Magic gems can be converted from one type to another through alchemy. This is can be done by any commander with magical skill by selecting the “Alchemy” order in the Orders list. This brings up the Alchemy screen, which allows gems to be converted from on to another. In general, alchemy can only convert gems into Astral gems, or convert Astral gems into gems of any other type. Either way, the rate is 2:1 old:new gems. It is possible to convert gems into Astral gems first and then into a different type
in a single turn. In that case, the rate is effectively 4:1 old:new, so this can get very expensive. A commander can only perform alchemy if he or she is in a province with a friendly laboratory.
Alchemy is also possible through magic. There are ritual spells which allow for this conversion. As would be expected, they are Earth and Fire spells of the Alteration school. These convert gems to gold, rather than gems to pearls.
From the tomes of the lore of Dominions
Xibalba is a vast realm of dark caverns beneath the forests of Mictlan. According to legend, the sun and the moon passed through the labyrinthine caverns on their daily journey to the eastern horizon. On this journey they were guarded by the bat people, Zotz, that dwelled in the dark reaches of the Xibalban underworld. Being almost blind, they would not see and not covet the splendor of the sun. No one has seen the sun or moon pass through Xibalba for ages, but the Zotz keep their vigil and traditions alive. Lately, the bat people have lost purpose and the priestly rulers of Xibalba look to the surface world to once more bask in the splendor of the sun and moon. The Zotz are led by priest kings from various cities, and only the priesthood represents centralized power. They still train the sacred Sun Guides that were once tasked with guarding the celestial entities through the dark world of Xibalba. The Zotz have contact with surface dwellers, primarily those of Mictlan, and have adopted some of their technology and practices. The Zotz have an affinity for blood hunting and black magic. Despite being guides of the sun, their skill in solar magic is limited. The Zotz are numerous and live in great swarming cave colonies. Numbers—rather than strength—allow them to win battles.
