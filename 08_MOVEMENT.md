Dominions 5 is a game of provinces. However, moving through them has changed significantly from previous versions of the game. This is because things were discovered to be different from what we thought before.
Movement still consists of going from one province to another, and depends on several things: the movement speed of the unit(s), the terrain in the province, and whether or not the province is friendly or enemy. In general, you can only move from one province to another if they are connected. To see a province's connections, hit the [8] key. These connections will be color-coded.
However, it is now possible to move through multiple provinces of enemy territory if your movement allowance is high enough.
The basic concepts regarding movement are as follows:
● Movement takes place as a series of “half-steps”: you move out of one province and into another.
● When you do this, you pay movement costs for each half-step according to the Movement Cost Table ● Stopping in an enemy province triggers combat, unless all entering units are Stealthy (like scouts).
● Armies with multiple units move at the speed of the slowest unit.
● Only commanders may move. Armies may not move if they are not led by a commander.
● Movement into or out of difficult terrain (forest, mountains, swamp) is affected by units' survival abilities.
General rules governing movement
Movement in Dominions 5 occurs from province to province, and is determined by a unit's map movement factor. If you right-click on any unit, you will see this factor next to the word "Map Move" in the unit attributes. A unit with "Map Move 12" has 12 movement points for moving on the strategic map. Even if a unit has a movement greater than 1, however, it is subject to certain restrictions.
Movement is calculated in “half-steps” which must be made to calculate the cost to leave, and then enter, each province. Each terrain has an associated movement cost:
Plains: 3
Forest: 5
Waste: 5
Sea: 5
Highlands: 6
Cave: 6
Swamp: 7
These are modified as follows:
Enemy province (moving unit does not have stealth): +4 Enemy province (moving unit has stealth): +3 Snow: +1 Roads: -2
(min. 2)
54
 Flying units Most terrain: Cave:
Enemy province:
If a unit has a survival ability, such as forest through that terrain with a -2 cost.
have different movement costs entirely:
    , swamp
Movement points for troops are based on the following general parameters:
There are two special terrain types which are properties of the borders between provinces rather than the provinces themselves: rivers and mountain passes.
Rivers may not be crossed unless the Cold scales in the provinces on both sides of that river border are +1 or greater (the river is frozen). Flying and floating units may cross rivers without penalty regardless of scales, as may units with the ability to enter water.
Mountain passes may be crossed if the Heat scales in the provinces on both sides of that river border are +1 or greater (the passes are open). Flying and floating units may cross mountain passes without penalty regardless of scales, as may units with the Mountain Survival ability.
Additional details about movement are listed below.
● Unless a unit is amphibious or aquatic it cannot enter an underwater province. [Poor amphibians are included, but differ from amphibians in combat.] Amphibians (poor or otherwise) may cross rivers without penalty.
● Aquatic units cannot enter land.
● A unit with the sailing ability may cross water provinces, but may not remain in such a province at the end of the turn. It may cross rivers.
Commanders are the only units which can be given orders to move.

Each unit has a specific map movement allowance but these are the general parameters.
All units (both the commander and his or her troops) must have the abilities listed above in order to take advantage of them. Just because a commander can fly doesn't mean his troops can. [Exception: some commanders can give their troops water-breathing abilities, and commanders with sailing can transport non-sailing units.]
Stopping in an enemy province triggers combat. [Exception: Stealthy units]
Armies move at the speed on the slowest unit in the army. Thus, forming armies composed of units with widely varying speeds will slow the whole group down.
Example of movement:
Aethelwald the Knight Commander of Avalon is leading his troop of knights (of Avalon) on a raid from the Canese Plain. He wants to strike into the Atlantian province of Ard. He has a map move of 22. Moving from Canese Plain to Trisia costs 3 to leave the plains province which is reduced to the minimum of 2 due to the road, and then entering Trisia costs 3 reduced to 2 (plains/road) as well. So far he has expended 4 movement points. Moving from Trisia to Sottera, however, costs 3 for the half-step to exit Trisia (total so far is 7 movement points expended), but the half-step to enter Sottera costs 3 for the plains, plus 4 for the fact that Sottera is an enemy province. That is 7 movement points to enter Sottera, making the overall total 14. To get to Ard, Aethelwald would have to spend 3 points to leave,
plus 4 for the enemy province, and then 3 to enter Ard, plus 4 for the fact that Ard is an enemy province as well. That would costs 28 points, and Aethelwald only has 22 (and the Knights of Man under his command only have a move of 20). He stops in Sottera and will fight the forces of Agartha.
Stealthy Units with the Stealth ability can move unseen from province to province. All movement restrictions apply normally.
Stealthy units ordered to sneak (the default order) move as normal but do not join in combat if they enter an enemy province that turn. Units already hiding in an enemy province can be given orders to attack that province in that turn. Certain special stealthy units have the ability to perform other tasks while in an enemy province, such as Instill Uprising or Assassinate Commander.
Units moving with Stealthy commanders must also be stealthy or the commander loses his ability to sneak while with them, and moves normally.
Stealthy units can be ordered to move normally by issuing the movement order while holding down the [Ctrl] key.
Glamour Units with the Glamour ability cannot be seen at all when in a friendly province. Glamour also gives units the Mirror Image ability in combat.
Darkvision Units with the Darkvision ability are less affected by darkness, depending on the level of their Darkvision attribute. Penalties for darkness affect a unit's Attack, Defense, and Precision. For normal units these are all reduced as follows: night -3, Utterdark -6, blind -9. Darkvision does not help you if you are blind.
Initiation of combat.
Combat in Dominions 5 is resolved between any mutually discovered enemy forces in a province where neither side has the benefit of a fortress. This means that you can have a scout or spy in a province with the enemy, but if he remains undiscovered, combat is not initiated. If one side is in a fortress, it cannot be assailed until the fortress is besieged and broken [see Sieges], or the defending force chooses to sortie [Break Siege].
More than two enemies in combat. If forces from different sides occupy the same province at the end of a turn (and neither one is in a fortress), they fight. If three or more sides have forces in a province at the end of a turn, the game will determine in which order they entered, and will fight the battles sequentially, with the survivors of each battle being the defenders in the next battle. There will never be more than two sides (attacker and defender) in a single battle.
Armies which are allied can occupy the same province. The above applies to allied armies as well. However, if allied armies are attacked, and thus the defenders in a battle, the attacker will fight each
        Example: Jotunheim, Marignon, and Pythium all enter Robber Home in the same turn. The game determines that Marignon got there first, followed by Pythium and Jotunheim. The first battle will therefore be Pythium attacking Marignon. Whichever side wins will then defend against the attack of Jotunheim, but only with those units that survived the first battle.
battle sequentially, and if he wins the first then the survivors will fight against the second defender, and so on. The order of the defenders is random.
ORDERS
Units can be given a variety of orders. A movement order is given simply by left-clicking on the commander’s icon, and then left-clicking on the destination province, whereupon a movement arrow will extend between the two provinces. This arrow is point-to-point and does not mean the moving unit will enter each province the arrow crosses. If the move is illegal (move too far, intervening rough terrain blocks, etc.) then the order will not be issued, and no arrow will be displayed. If the move order is legal but becomes illegal before hosting the turn (e.g. removing Flying Boots from a commander crossing difficult terrain), the move arrow remains, but the commander will not move, because the changed move order is validated during turn hosting.
Move
Move to another province. If it is an enemy province, combat will occur. This is the default move for when left-clicking on another province while an active non-stealthy commander is selected.
Sneak
Sneaking is movement into enemy provinces without being detected. Only Stealthy units can attempt such moves. Their chance of success (and of staying hidden in an enemy province once they are there) depends on their Stealth rating, the number of units trying to hide, and the number of units looking for them. Provincial defense automatically searches for hidden units in its province each turn as long as the defense level is 15 or greater. A commander, however, must be set to the Patrol order. Fast units, like cavalry, or units which fly, are better at revealing hidden units than slow units or non-flying units are.
Units with a Patrol bonus   are also better, as you might expect. Units may also Sneak and attack, which allows stealthy units hiding in an enemy province to attack an adjacent enemy province.
Combat will not occur unless the unit is discovered by patrollers or other means. This is the default move for stealthy units. To give a stealthy commander the order to move normally (and thus attack the province it enters), hold down [Ctrl] while left-clicking on the destination province.
A stealthy commander will not sneak unless all units under his or her command are stealthy as well.
Removing non-stealthy units from the commander will not automatically change his move back to sneak.
Patrol
Patrolling a province both reduces unrest and has a chance to discover hidden units. Some units are
better at patrolling than others (fast units, flying units, or units with patrol bonus ). For each point of unrest eliminated in a province by patrollers, the population is reduced by 10. This represents the permanent elimination of the troublemakers. The larger the patrolling force, the more effective it is. A provincial defense level of 15 can act as a patrolling force for purposes of detecting stealthy units, but it is not as effective as an actual army. If there is no unrest in a province, nobody gets hurt by patrollers. Patrollers will fight an attacking army, just like the order below.
The success of the Patrol order depends on the Stealth ability of the units that are hiding, their number, the provincial defense (if any), and the “Destealth strength” of the patrolling units. Destealth is affected by unrest.
Stealth strength: Stealth value of leader -1 per stealthy unit in his army (or zero if unit has >=+50 in stealth)
Destealth strength: Sum of Destealth strength of all patrolling units - unrest/2 (capped at unrest 100) + (province defence - 14 if province defence is 15 or greater)
The stealthy units are found if the Destealthy strength + 2d25 (open-ended) > Stealth strength + 2d25 (open-ended).
The individual Destealth strength of a given unit = (Precision + (AP value, or 30 if flying)) / 20. Units with a Patrol bonus   add the Patrol bonus to their individual Destealth strength.
Defend Province
This is exactly the same as the Patrol order except that there is no patrolling going on. Units will simply enter combat against any non-Stealthy units entering the province. Unrest is not reduced, but the province is still defended. This is the default order.
The difference between “Patrol” and “Defend” in a province with a fortress is that patrollers will engage in combat outside the fortress, while defenders will concede the province and become besieged.
Stealthy units given the Defend order will fight enemies attacking the province, rather than hiding.
Defend Castle
Units ordered to defend a castle will not fight an enemy force entering the province containing the castle. Instead, they will become besieged. (See Combat section.)
Movement is carried out in two steps.
● First, all units moving to a friendly province do so.
● Afterward, movement takes place in which units are moving to an enemy province.
Thus, if you are moving an army to one of your provinces, and an enemy is moving an army to that same province, your army will get there first, and thus be able to join with any forces that are already there to try and repel the invasion. Of course, the enemy might be able to prevent your army from moving at all, through various other actions.
However, if you are each attacking the province of a third nation, one of you will get there first. This is determined randomly.
Likewise, if you give an army the order to move into an adjacent enemy province, and on the same turn an army in that province gets the order to move into yours, then one of three things can happen:
● There is a battle in the enemy province between the two armies; ● There is a battle in your province between the two armies;
● The armies miss one another and exchange places.
Which event occurs depends on the size of the armies in question and the terrain involved.
Important: If you order a force into a friendly province containing a fortress, it will automatically "enter" the fortress and behave as though it has the order "Defend Castle." Thus, if you have one army defending a province with a castle, but it is assigned the Patrol order, and you move another army into that province to reinforce it, and then an enemy army attacks, the first army will fight, but not the second. If the first army loses, the enemy will besiege the second army in the castle.
If you want to have the second army join the first, or if you only have one army moving to a province and you don’t want to have it just go into the fortress, but want to battle in the province itself, you must use Move and Patrol.
Move and Patrol
This order only become available to a unit once it has been given an order to move into a friendly province with a fortress in it. After giving the initial move order, you can click on the commander’s orders again, and “Move and Patrol” will now appear as a choice. Selecting this will instruct the commander to move to the province and then patrol, and will cause it to engage enemy units entering that province in combat.
Blood Hunt
This is how blood slaves are collected for the sacrifices required for blood magic. In order to successfully blood hunt in a province, a blood hunter must pass three successive checks.
● First, a level check: % chance of success = 10 + (blood level x 40)
● Second, a population check: % chance of success = province’s population / 50 ● Third, an unrest check: % chance of failure = province unrest / 4
If all of these are successful, the number of slaves the blood hunter will find is: d6 + blood level
and the unrest in the province will increase by d(slaves x 3 +4). That’s a random number between 1 and three times the number of blood slaves found, plus 4.
If any of those checks fails, the result is no slaves found, and a d6 – 1 increase in unrest.
Break Siege
This orders units besieged in a fortress to fight a battle against the enemy units in that province. Units which retreat flee back into the castle, or into a neighboring friendly province. If both options are possible, there is a 50% chance of going into the castle and 50% chance to go somewhere else.
Maintain Siege
This is the default order for any units besieging a fortress. It does not have to be given unless you change such a commander’s order, and then need to change it back.
Storm Castle
This order is only available if you have successfully reduced a castle’s defenses to zero. On the next turn, you will be given the opportunity to storm the castle. This initiates a battle in which the defenders begin behind their own castle walls. Because castle storming occurs after movement, a besieging force may be forced to fight a battle against an enemy relieving force arriving from outside the besieged
province, and if the relieving force wins, the castle is not stormed. If the relieving force is defeated, the besieging force may still be left with a significantly reduced strength when storming the castle.
Assassinate
A random enemy commander in that province is targeted for assassination. The assassin will fight a battle with the commander, plus any bodyguards assigned to that commander. Each bodyguard has a 50% chance of being present at the time of the assassination attempt, and this chance is increased by the Bodyguard ability. The Assassin's Patience value can decrease the chance of bodyguards being present. The target of an assassination is considered to be surprised and will not follow any scripted orders he or she may have. Assassinations have a 50% chance of happening at night. If so, darkness penalties apply.
Preach
This allows priests to increase dominion in a province. The formula is involved, and explained fully in the dominion chapter. In short, the chance of success depends on the level of the preacher.
Pillage
Pillaging a province increases unrest and kills population in a province, decreases that province’s supplies, and gains gold and food for the pillaging army. The larger the pillaging force, the greater the chance of success. Fast units and large units are better than others at pillaging, while barbarians and units with the Fear ability are exceptionally good. The supplies gained last only one month.
Raid
A raid is a move that can only be performed by a commander with the Pillage ability if all of the units under his command also have this ability. The force under his command can raid an adjacent province, killing population, causing unrest, and gaining gold. It is essentially the same as the Pillage order except it is performed from an adjacent province. The raiding force returns to its starting province after the raid.
Reanimate
This is an order available to many undead priests, some nations (Ermor, Lanka), and some units (Carrion Lords and their servants). Asphodel gets manikins instead of normal undead. Asphodel cannot choose what to reanimate – they just get random types of manikins and undead.
Reanimation table
Contact Allies Some commanders are able to gather more troops by spending the month gathering them. Draconians are an example.
     Raiders may be discovered by province defense or patrollers. A limited combat is initiated if the raiders
 are caught. In this case it will be a battle between PD + patrollers and raiders. Winning the battle will not
 conquer the province and there will be no pillaging done that turn regardless of outcome.

Perform Blood Sacrifice A blood sacrifice may only be performed in a province with a temple, by a nation which has the ability to perform such sacrifices because it has been part of their history. These nations are:
Early age: Mictlan, Marverni, Sauromatia, Abysia, Pangaea, Vanheim, Helheim, Hinnom, Berytos Middle age: Abysia, Vanheim
Late age: Marignon, Mictlan, Abysia, Midgård, Gath
Capture Slaves This order is only available to Mictlan. A 1d6 + 4 number of slaves are rounded up and forced to join the armies of Mictlan. They are weak and cowardly soldiers but are free to recruit.
Become Prophet This order designates the unit as the one and only prophet of the nation’s pretender god. The unit’s priest level is increased by 1 or to 3, whichever is higher, and the prophet will start spreading dominion like a temple. There are other effects as well, such as increased hit points in friendly dominion (and decreased hit points in enemy dominion). If a prophet is killed, the nation must wait half a year (6 turns) before designating a new prophet.
Instill Uprising This order is only available to certain units, such as spies and bards. It will increase the level of unrest in the enemy province they occupy.
Hide
Stealthy units who are not moving will get the default order of Hide. A unit hiding in a province (including a friendly province) will not participate in any combat in that province, unless discovered, in which case a separate battle will be fought.
Attack Current Province
This order is available to Stealthy units which are hiding in an enemy province. The unit will join with friendly units attacking the province, if there are any. It is treated as a movement order of distance zero.
Turn resolution sequence
All players’ turn orders are resolved simultaneously when a turn is hosted. During the hosting process, the game resolves orders in the following order:
       1. Send messages
2. Research
3. Empowerment 4. Recruitment
Messages sent by using the Send Messages button are dispatched. This means that gold, gems, and items are always sent, because everything that could stop this from happening occurs later in the turn.
Mages perform their research. Even if a mage is assassinated or otherwise killed, he will contribute his research points to his nation that turn.
Increased magic paths due to Empowerment are conferred here.
New units and commanders are recruited. This means that recruits will always be available during the turn, as nothing that happens beforehand can stop them.

New items are forged and placed in their nation’s magic item inventory. Priests preach the word of their god, and dominion is adjusted accordingly. Heretics, insane commanders and commanders with shattered soul preach. Thrones of Ascension are claimed now.
A few special orders are quicker than others, such as Enter Site to Scry and Cultivate Pearls
All mages cast their rituals in a random order.
All battles caused by magic are resolved. For example, commanders taken
away by Wind Ride or teleporting to an enemy province fight now.
If a unit becomes lost in another plane, it happens now. This includes resolving battles fought in other planes.
Magic site searches are resolved.
Prophets are declared.
Priests call their gods who have been banished.
Pretenders awaken (dormant or imprisoned)
The hunt for blood slaves takes place.
Units are visited by Horrors now, if such a misfortune should befall them. Assassination attempts are resolved. The battles are fought immediately. Units with the Raid order perform that here.
Commanders with the Relinquish Province order will relinquish the province to any non-stealthed allied commander already present in the same province.
All movement ending in a friendly province takes place now. If you are trying to get to a friendly province before an enemy does, you will do it if you are not stopped by an event that takes place in steps 1 through 21.
All other movement, including Break Siege, takes place. All battle resolution from movement happens here. Castles are stormed and battles resolved.

Global enchantments take effect on the world. Note that the casting takes place during the Rituals step (10), though.
Like it says. This is where those Fortune/Misfortune events happen. Battles caused by these events happen now.
Special effects from magic items (or monsters) take place. The items themselves are forged during the Forge step (5), though. If any of these effects result in any battles, they are resolved now.
Stealthy units have been discovered! If so, they fight now for their lives.
If two allies are besieging the same castle, the one who is besieging is decided now. Larger armies take precedence.
Fortresses, temples, and labs are built (or demolished).
Special order like Reanimate or Summon Allies are performed. Thus, allies summoned during a turn will not be available for that turn’s battles.
The Pillage order increases unrest and kills population.
All nations collect income for their provinces. Note that this comes after Pillage, meaning that if you pillage a province you conquered, you will gain reduced income from it, or perhaps no income at all.
Changes in unrest from dominion, scales, and patrolling are reflected.
Units without supplies suffer starvation effects. This means that the first turn an army goes without supplies, it will fight its battles without starvation effects, since all battles occur in previous steps.
Unit upkeep is paid for. Note that this is after income is collected for the turn. Desertion happens now as well.
All dominion spread (for whatever reason) is conducted now.
Special effects of dominion (population death, insanity, spreading heat or cold etc.) are applied.
Magic sites spread disease, unrest, and the like, if they have such an effect.
A rare occurrence: if there are over 150,000 units in the world, some of the most numerous ones will be killed to keep the game running smoothly.

Any leftover battles caused by previous events are resolved.
All units regain lost hit points, unless they are diseased, in which case they suffer more damage instead and may incur more afflictions.
Units may go insane, from certain dominion or other effects. Mercenaries are bought or maintained.
Heroes may appear at a nation's capital gates.
Lone units (non-commanders) in enemy provinces are killed. If there are units without commanders inside enemy territory they will be killed here to prevent them from making any pointless attacks.
If a fort does not own the province it is in and it is not under siege, it will take ownership of the province. This can happen in team games where the province and the fort might have different owners from the same team. This step is resolved in favor of the owner of the fort.
New scouting reports are generated for each player.
Players without any provinces or dominion are eliminated from the game.
If a victory condition is fulfilled, the game declares a winner and ends.
Hall of Fame and scoregraphs are updated.
Units gain and improve heroic abilities.
Immortals that are due to return will reform their bodies here.
Province defense is reduced if the population cannot support the current level. At least 10 population is required for each point of province defense.
The game validates orders and items, changes shapes if necessary, etc.
