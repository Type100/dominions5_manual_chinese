Dominions 5 is all about units. These range from weak, lightly armed militia to giant monsters of unspeakable horror and magnitude. In between there are bards, mages, bandits, dragons, and many others. Some units become available as the results of summoning spells, while others are recruitable through the basic provincial population. Each province has its own recruitable units. Some units may require a structure such as a temple or laboratory before they can be recruited. Some can only be recruited in a province with a particular magic site.
Each nation has a unique set of units that can only be accessed in provinces with a friendly fort. At the start of the game, this will be the starting fort in a nation’s home province. Later, as you build new fortresses, you’ll be able to recruit those units in those provinces, too, although some units are recruitable only in your capital, from a magic site located there.
There is a basic distinction between units and commanders: units are the troops that make up your squads, while commanders are the individuals who either lead these squads or perform other tasks like research or item crafting. Some attributes are exclusive to commanders, like leadership and the ability to change equipment inventory or carry gems. The list below summarizes all of these attributes.
You can get further information about an ability simply by clicking on it. This will bring up a window which shows how this value has been modified. For example, a unit may have a base morale value of 12, but due to experience (+1) and friendly dominion (+1) the modified value is 14. Clicking on the attribute will show its modifications.
Some attributes show further attributes
Basic attributes
Hit Points: Everyone knows what this is.
Size: Size determines how many units can be in a single square on the battlefield (a maximum of 6
points). It also determines how many supplies a unit needs each turn (Size minus 1). Strength: This determines how much damage a unit does when it successfully strikes a target. Attack: This determines the unit’s chances of successfully striking a target with melee weapons. Defense: This determines the unit’s chances of avoiding a strike by melee weapons.
Protection: This is the unit’s armor rating. It can be different on different parts of the body,
depending on equipment worn or simply the nature of the creature’s hide. These separate values
will be shown when you click on Protection.
Morale: This measures a unit’s likelihood of running from battle.
Magic Resistance: Think of this as Protection, only against magic. Not all spells have to penetrate
Magic Resistance, though.
Precision: This is how accurate a unit is, either with missiles or with magic.
Encumbrance: A unit will incur Fatigue equal to its Encumbrance on each turn it attacks. Moving
—by itself—does not incur this.
Map Move: This determines how far a unit can move on the world map, subject to the movement
costs listed under Movement on page [54].
Combat Speed: This determines how far the unit can move in combat. Each point of combat speed
corresponds to roughly one square on the combat map. 
Fatigue: A unit’s Fatigue causes it to be more susceptible to critical strikes. Once a unit reaches 100 fatigue, it becomes unconscious and is unable to attack or defend. A unit at 200 fatigue starts taking regular hit point damage instead of fatigue damage from additional fatigue.
Age: The first number is the unit’s age in years. The number in parentheses is the age at which the unit will start suffering penalties and become susceptible to afflictions due to old age. This attribute is displayed when you click on Fatigue. The age when you start suffering penalties is referred to as max age. It is modified by the following (in order of priority):
● undead creatures have their max age increased by 50% per point of Death magic
● inanimate creatures have their max age increased by 50% per point of Earth magic
● demons have their max age increased by 50% per point of Blood magic
● everyone has his or her max age increased by 50% per point of Nature magic
● creatures whose max age is modified by Nature have it reduced 5% per point of Fire magic (burn bright, burn fast)
There are three kinds of Leadership, and apply to Commanders only.
Leadership: This is the number of units a commander can lead.
Undead Leadership: Like leadership, but for undead beings. A commander can lead 30 undead
beings per level of Death magic skill and 5 per level of Blood magic skill he or she has. Magical leadership: As above, but for magical beings. This is determined by indirect magic
bonuses (see Indirect Magic chart – not all paths confer the same benefits). Units also may have special abilities. Some of these are summarized below. Special abilities
Units in Dominions 5 can have a wide variety of special abilities. In fact, there are over 350 such abilities in the game. Each modifies the unit’s attributes or capabilities in some way. A mouse-over or right-click on the ability in the stats screen will give an explanation of what it does. Some of these attributes bear further explanation, which appear below.
 Ambidextrous Berserker
Ethereal Glamour Recuperation Sailing
Unit classes
There is no icon for this ability, but you will find it if you click on Attack. It reduces the penalty for wielding two weapons by an amount equal to the Ambidextrous level.
A unit with this ability goes berserk when wounded if it passes a morale check vs. 12. Berserk units fight until dead – they do not rout. A unit with +Berserk ability gets that number as a bonus to its berserk attributes.
Very difficult to hit with non-magical weapons. 75% of such strikes will miss. These units gain Mirror Image in combat, and are undetectable in friendly provinces. This unit can heal its battle afflictions over time, unless it has the Old Age icon.
Can cross (but not remain in) water provinces when moving.
Some special ability divide units into classes. The classes may have special requirements for leadership.
Magic being Mindless
Undead
These units require a mage to lead them. They rout if left without magical leadership. Mindless beings suffer mindless dissolution on the battlefield if left without a commander. Mindless units cannot be in the same squad as non-mindless units.
Undead units are subject to banishment, as are demons. Undead and demon units require undead leadership, which is generally conferred by skill in Death magic (or being an
undead commander). Zombies aren’t going to take orders from just anybody. A squad that mixes undead and non-undead gets a -1 morale penalty, for obvious reasons.
Several abilities have detailed effects.
Awe Units with Awe force enemies to take a morale check against 10 + Awe in order to be able to attack them. Thus, a unit with Awe +4 would force attackers to pass a morale check against 14, or be awestruck and unable to attack the awe-inspiring monster on that combat round. There is a special kind of Awe called Sun Awe which does not work underground, or when it is dark.
Fear Units in a monster’s Fear area of effect get their morale temporarily lowered and their entire squad must take a morale check against the monster’s Fear, or rout. The basic Fear effect requires a check against 10. Unlike Awe, the bonus to Fear indicates the additional area of effect, not the Fear strength. So a Fear +4 monster has normal Fear that radiates to 4 additional squares. The Fear strength itself is increased for every full +5 Fear, so a Fear +10 unit would radiate to ten additional squares, and force a morale check against 12. The base area of effect (Fear +0) is 6 squares.
Heat Units with this ability radiate heat into adjacent squares. You will see this as little black smoke. This causes 5 armor-negating points of fatigue damage. It is considered fire damage, so units with fire resistance have protection. A fire resistance of 5 or greater negates the effects of a heat aura. The default size of a heat aura is 3 squares and is increased by Fire magic. Some monsters may have a greater heat aura, which has a larger area of effect.
Chill This is exactly the same as Heat, except the stun damage is cold, and thus units with cold resistance have protection. It looks like bluish-white smoke. The default size of a chill aura is 3 squares and is increased by Water magic.
Poison cloud This is the green smoke. Each turn the area of effect is blasted by poison, and anyone in this area takes 2 points of armor-negating poison damage. This effect actually lasts for two turns, so a single unit can take multiple poison damage effects from a single source.
Heat, Chill, and Poison Cloud effects stack, so if a unit is in a square where three Abysians are radiating heat, that unit will take damage from each.
Stun Stun prevents a unit from taking any action for one round.
Invisibility Units that are invisible cannot be seen. You suffer a -10 penalty to Attack when attacking a unit you cannot see in melee. In order to see invisible units you must have the ability Spirit Sight. Units that are blind anyway are not further penalized when attacking invisible enemies.
Petrification This is the medusa's special ability. Anyone attacking her is petrified if the attacker fails a magic resistance roll. After about 3-6 rounds, the petrification is lost. If the unit passes a magic resistance check upon losing its petrification, it returns to normal. If it does not, it dies.
Seduction Some units can seduce and make enemy commanders of the opposite gender switch sides. Nagini and succubi have versions of this power. The nagini must be adjacent to a friendly province into which the target is taken. A succubus flies with a seduced target to her master’s capital.
With the succubus, the target makes a magic resistance check against 16. If it fails, the dream manifestation is successful and the succubus tries to seduce the commander. If the commander fails a morale check vs. the seduction ability, the commander and succubus fly to the capital. If the seduction fails, the commander is attacked by the succubus in an assassination attempt.
The procedure is the same for the nagini, although that unit has a lower seduction ability (10). If successful, the lovers will sneak to a neighboring province instead of the capital.
Lure of the sirens works in a similar way. First there is a magic resistance check, followed by a morale check against the lure ability (10). The lure can only be used in coastal provinces. Failure doesn’t cause an assassination battle, which makes the siren’s attempt rather safe. If successful, the target drowns himself, or enters the sea and attacks the siren in an assassination attempt if he is able to breathe underwater (and returns to land if he survives).
Standard The standard ability increases the morale of the entire squad it is in. Only the best standard for every squad will have a morale increasing effect.
Horror Marking A horror mark is a condition which can lead to dire results. A horror mark will result in a small chance each month that a unit will be attacked by a horror. A unit can be horror-marked more than once which will increase this chance, but there is no way of knowing how bad the mark is. Certain spells will cause a horror-marked unit to be attacked. In battle Horrors always attacked a horror-marked unit first. Stronger horror marks also attract stronger horrors.
Trample Trample is exactly what it sounds like – a large unit runs over a smaller one. Smush! A trampling unit displaces all of the units in the square it enters to an adjacent square. These units have to take a Defense – (fatigue / 10) check against 10. If they fail this check, they take 5 + 2xSize trample damage. This is an armor-piercing attack, so Protection is halved. A trampled unit will always take at least one point of damage, regardless of Protection. A unit which successfully passes the defense check is still displaced, but just takes one point of damage, total.
Swallow Some monsters are able to swallow the target of a successful trampling attack. The swallowed monsters are removed from the battlefield until the swallowing monster is killed. Some monsters are able to digest swallowed targets, which does damage to the swallowed target each turn, and some monsters can even incorporate the swallowed target into their own bodies and get extra hit points from the damage they do to swallowed creatures.
Additional abilities
There are many other unit attributes, which you can get information on by right-clicking on or mousing over the effect in the unit’s stat window. An ability granted by a magic item, such as Regeneration or Fire Resistance, will be listed with the other abilities, and information about it can be found in the same way.
You can see a (nearly) full list of abilities in the Modding Manual included with the game.
XP: Experience Points
Units which survive the world of Dominions for a period of time are likely to get experience. Units usually gain 1 XP per month, but can gain more through combat. Each level gives a bonus to Prec, Att, Def, and Morale.
Heroic Abilities
Non-pretender commanders who join the Hall of Fame get heroic abilities. These are denoted by a yellow star in a red circle, and can grant increased attributes, such as strength, leadership, magic resistance, and the like. Unique beings such as the Elemental Royalty cannot enter the Hall of Fame.
Afflictions
Units may suffer battle affliction when they suffer damage. The chance is simply the percentage of its total normal hit points a unit suffers on that strike. In other words, an infantry unit with a healthy strength of 10 hp will have a 20% chance of suffering an affliction upon taking 2 hp damage. The location of hits is important! Loss of an arm or an eye depends on being hit in the right place.
Afflictions are denoted by a red heart. A unit may suffer from multiple afflictions. Diseased units may gain additional afflictions each turn. Afflictions can be healed by the following methods:
● Units with the Recuperation special ability heal afflictions over time (unless they have Old Age).
● Units that are Immortal (or Dominion Immortal) may heal afflictions when they reform after dying.
● Units with an involuntary shapechange mechanic (such as Jaguar Warriors of Mictlan) can sometimes heal afflictions when they change back to their normal shape. This is checked every time they change back to their first shape, but it is not a reliable method of healing.
● Units with the autohealer ability will cure a number of afflictions up to the value of the ability automatically in the same province every turn.
● Units with the disease healer ability will automatically cure a number of diseases equal to the value of the ability in the same province every turn.
● The global enchantment Gift of Health will automatically cure afflictions in the dominion of its owner (including allied nations in disciple games as long as dominion is positive).
● The artifact The Chalice will automatically cure up to 5 afflictions in the same province.
● There are a few magic sites that can heal afflictions like a healer
● Afflictions have a difficulty level that is checked against when subjected to healing. If the healing check succeeds, the affliction is cured.
● Undead beings cannot heal afflictions unless they have Recuperation or Immortality, except through Gift of Health.
● Afflictions caused by cursed items such as Eye of Aiming and The Black Heart cannot be healed unless the item is removed first.
Afflictions are different from Curses or Horror Marks. The later two entities cannot be removed. Horror marks may be lessened by staying dead.
RECRUITING UNITS
Recruiting units is the main method of adding troops to your armies. Recruitment is done per province, so as you capture provinces, you gain the ability to recruit new types of troops. In some coastal provinces, these troops may be amphibious.
● Each province has its own pool of units.
● Some national units can only be recruited in a nation’s capital
● Building a fort in a province adds a nation’s non-capital troops to that province’s pool. ● Gold and resources are spent to produce units.
● Some nations can recruit additional units outside their forts, depending on terrain
Recruitment costs
Units have two costs: gold and resources. In the world of Dominions, a unit’s training is reflected in its gold cost, while its equipment requires the resources. Expect highly skilled units to cost a lot of gold, heavily equipped units to cost a lot of resources, and highly skilled, heavily equipped units to cost a fortune.
Sacred units also have a Holy point cost, which is always 1 per unit (including sacred commanders, which was not the case in Dominions 3).
Recruitment restrictions
There are some restrictions not only on how many units of a type can be recruited in one turn, but how they can be queued as well.
Commanders: Gold: Resources:
Holy: Limited:
You can only recruit as many commanders in a province in a turn as you have available recruitment points. Commanders can cost more than one point.
Units may only be recruited up to the limit of that nation’s current treasury. Units cannot be queued up for the next turn based on gold cost.
Units may only be recruited in a province in a given turn based on that province’s current resources, but they may be queued for following turns. This makes it possible players to recruit units in provinces that don’t produce enough resources to fulfill that unit’s resource requirement in a single turn. Units that cannot be built in the current turn, but are in the queue, are dimmed in the recruitment area. Sacred units can only be recruited up to the home province’s Holy limit, which is the same as the current maximum dominion. Units can be added to the queue beyond the Holy limit.
Some units may have a recruitment limít that only allows a certain number to be recruited per turn (e.g. maximum of 5 Troglodytes per turn, regardless of available gold or resources).
Units are recruited at the beginning of the turn resolution, so units in a province being attacked in the same turn they are recruited will fight to defend the province. If they are recruited in a fortress then they will stay in the fortress and become besieged.
Recruited units go into the unassigned unit pool of units at the top of the Army Setup screen. Below them you will see all your commanders in that province.
Holding down [SHIFT] while selecting a unit for recruiting will choose ten of that unit. Up to 250 units may be queued in a province.
ARMY SETUP
 Garrison units
At the top of the screen, below the province name, is a single row where all unassigned, or garrison units, are shown. Newly recruited units get placed here, and stay there until they are assigned to a commander (or the province is invaded and they are killed in battle). If the province contains a fortress, these units are considered inside the walls and don’t join any patrolling units in combat. If the province has no fortress, they do participate in combat, and form one large squad at the center of the battlefield.
Squads
Squads are the basic organizational unit of combat. They can contain anywhere from 1 unit to the limit of their commander’s leadership value. A commander cannot lead more units than this value, no matter how many or few squads they are split into. A commander can lead a maximum of five squads, although depending on the commander's leadership, additional squads may suffer a morale penalty. Thus, the maximum number of squads in an army is five times the number of commanders. Some units require their commanders to have special abilities in order to lead them, like undead leadership for undead and demons or magical leadership for magical beings. Units that are both undead and magic beings require undead leadership.
All commanders in a province will appear with their icons on the far left side of the Army Setup screen, with their placement window next to them followed by their name and squad information. Their squads will be arranged below them, with a battle placement box, a unit count, and the Set Battle Orders menu.
The Army Setup screen is where you deploy your units for battle. When said battle occurs, units will be placed on the map in accordance with their squad’s arrangement in the Position squad box. They will attempt to follow the battle orders given (see Set Battle Orders below). The screens works like this:
To place a unit into a squad, click on the unit, and then either click on the squad box of a currently existing squad (if you want to add that unit to the squad), or click on the icon of the commander himself (if you want to create a new squad. When a new squad is created, a new box will open below the commander’s box and the unit will appear there. If a commander has no units assigned yet, this is how you start—just add the first unit to a new squad by clicking on the unit, then on the commander. Units can be added to a commander up to the limit of his Leadership value.
The limits on number of units and number of squads is displayed at the far right of the Army Setup screen.
Selection shortcuts can help you sort through the different units in the Army Setup screen.
Thus, you can more easily go through and find all the limping units, and put them elsewhere so that holes do not open up in your squads as they advance because the limping units are falling behind. You can likewise make elite squads of experienced troops that will have higher morale than other squads of their type.
Battle Position
There are green boxes to the right of each commander’s icon on the left side of the Army Setup screen are Position Commander and Position Squad boxes, which for short this manual will call the Battle Position box when it is talking about both. Similar boxes appear to the right of each squad (on the right edge of the Army Setup screen). These boxes define where a unit will appear on the battlefield initially. The box shows all of the units currently occupying the province. Commanders are shown in blue, and squads in orange. The currently selected unit (either squad or commander) is highlighted in white. By clicking on the green area in the Battle Position box, you can move the icon of the squad or commander around. At the top of the screen, the words “Back...” and “...Front” show that the left side is the back of your formation, and the right side is the front. Note that the size of a squad or commander is reflected in the size of its box. The predominant unit icon is displayed to help you keep track of which squad contains what type of units.
When a battle begins, a squad will appear on the battlefield according to its location in the Position Squad box.
Battle Orders
Because players don’t control units directly in combat, squads have to be issued orders which they then attempt to follow once combat is joined. Each squad can be issued a different order, even if it is under the leadership of the same commander. Squads can be assigned general orders, or general and target orders. The ones indicated by an asterisk (*) require target orders – the remainder do not.

Hold and attack*
Fire and keep distance* Retreat
This simply turns the control of this squad over to the computer. It will decide what is best.
This will engage an enemy in melee
Missile units will fire at a target until they are out of missiles.
The unit will move toward the commander and protect him or her from harm. If there is an assassination attempt on the commander, these units have a chance of fighting in the assassination battle with their commander.
The squad will hold in place for two turns. If it is armed with missile weapons, it will fire at targets in range. After two rounds, it will advance to melee combat. The squad will fire missile weapons until their target gets close, and then attempt to withdraw to a safe range and keep firing.
The squad retreats off the battlefield. This is treated exactly like a rout and the units may scatter to adjacent provinces.
 If you have chosen Attack/Hold and Attack or Fire/Fire and keep distance, you must specify who you that squad is attacking, or at whom that squad is firing.
Target orders None
Archers Cavalry Fliers
Large monsters
Closest Rearmost
Targets one random enemy and his squad
Targets a random enemy archer and its squad
Targets a random enemy cavalry unit and its squad
Targets a random enemy unit which can fly, and its squad
Targets one random enemy of size 5 or 6 and its squad. If no enemy of this size exists, a size 4 unit will be treated as a large monster.
The squad will target the closest enemy squad
The squad will target a random enemy at the rear of the enemy battle formation.
 No matter what orders a squad is given, it may not get there if it gets stuck in the zone of control of an enemy unit that gets in the way.
     Question: Can’t my soldiers be ordered to just sit back and defend indefinitely?
Answer: No. Hold and Attack will have your troops stay in place for 2 rounds, but after that, they attack.
         
From the tomes of the lore of Dominions
A Niefel Giant is a frost giant descended from the old Rimtursar. They have sprung from the glaciers of Niefelheim, the land of eternal frost. Niefel Giants are constantly surrounded by an icy wind and their bodies temper and strengthen in cold lands. They are led by ancient Jarls skilled in the use of magics of frost and death. All Niefel Giants are sacred to the Jotuns.
Commander orders
Commanders can be given orders just like squads. In the commander battle orders menu, the top four orders are specific, while the bottom four are general orders. Specific orders last for one turn, while general orders guide the commander’s actions for the rest of the combat.
Up to five specific orders can be scripted for a single commander. If a commander receives no orders, the AI will assign them to him.
Scripts of orders can be copied from one commander to another. Hold the mouse over the script you wish to copy and hold down the [Ctrl] key, and then hit a number key. The script will be stored under this number. Then, place the mouse over the <set battle orders> text of a commander to whom you wish to copy the script, and hit the same number key (without holding down [Ctrl]). The script will be copied
to the new commander. You can store multiple scripts by using the 0-9 keys.
Specific orders
Hold one turn Hold position for one turn
Hold or Fire missile weapon
  Hold or Cast a spell
Cast a specific spell
Attack one turn
General orders Stay behind troops
Attack
Same as hold position, except that commander will fire a missile weapon.
Same as hold position, except that commander will cast a spell (chosen by the AI) if possible. Only available for spellcasters.
Cast a spell specified by the player if the commander has sufficient gems and there is a valid target in range. If one of those two conditions is not met, the AI will choose a spell to cast.
Commander will move toward a random enemy for one turn and engage it in
melee
if possible
The commander will cast spells, fire missile weapons, and attempt to place himself or herself in the rearmost part of the army.
The commander will move towards enemies and attempt to engage them in melee
The commander will cast spells chosen by the AI
The commander will advance to be close to the front and cast spells. If possible, a few spells will be cast while advancing as well.
The commander will attempt to rout off the map.
 Cast spells
Advance and cast spells Retreat
Checking the box "conservative gem use" will ensure that the mage uses his gems as sparingly as possible and for scripted spells only. This can be useful if you want to save gems for later battles.
UNIT INVENTORIES
Commanders’ inventories are important places for equipment. Clicking on an empty inventory slot takes you directly to your nation’s magic item inventory (if you are in a province with a lab), and selecting an item in this screen will equip that slot with it. Magic items can grant the wearer all sorts of benefits, which are given in the Magic Item section of the appendix. Not all units will have all inventory slots, though. The example shown below is for a typical human commander. A non-human commander may not have a head slot, for instance. Or no feet. Cavalry commanders do not have a foot slot, because they use a horse or other mount for transport instead of their own feet.
A unit can be upgraded with better armor and weapons simply by giving him or her a superior item. However, the unit’s standard items cannot be removed, and when the new item is withdrawn, the standard item re-appears.
Magic gem inventory
Commanders may also carry magic gems, which mages can use for a variety of purposes. Gems can be transferred between commanders in the same province by clicking on the Magic Resource Treasury [F7] in the main screen and then clicking on “Transfer gems to commanders” button, or simply clicking on a commander’s personal magic items inventory slot, which goes directly to the Transfer Magic Resources screen, shown below.
Up to two commanders in the province will be shown. If there is a laboratory in the province, the right-hand column will show the nation’s magic gem inventory. Otherwise, this right-most column will be greyed out.
Gems can be moved between columns by right- or left- clicking on the number in a particular column: left-clicking will increase it, while right-clicking will decrease it.
Any commander can carry gems, even if he or she cannot use them. Because the gem-carrying limit is 30, sometimes it can be helpful to have a commander accompany a mage as a “gem squire.”
