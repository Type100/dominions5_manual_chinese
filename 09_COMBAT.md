Combat is what happens when two discovered enemy forces occupy the same location on the map. If one force or both forces are undiscovered, no combat will occur. Thus, a stealthy force may move right through an enemy and not trigger combat. Thus, both forces are not discovered. Two forces which are both discovered may occupy the same province, but one might be in a fortress which has not yet been breached. In this case, the forces are in different locations (one in the fort, the other besieging in the province). When one army is in a fort and one army besieging, the province is owned by the besieging player and the fort is owned by the besieged. This situation is known as partial ownership of the province. When the same player owns both fort and province, the situation is known as full ownership. Full and partial ownership of a province have certain effects in-game (e.g. some events cannot happen in a partially owned province because they require full ownership as a precondition to happening).
Once combat occurs, units move according to their tactical movement allowance on a grid placed over the map. You can toggle this grid by hitting the [g] key or the [w] key.
Players can find battles overwhelming. This is easy to do if you try to follow every swing of every weapon. It's not necessary.
It is important to understand that battles in Dominions are not fought to the death. They are fought until one side loses its nerve and routs. As will be explained in the section to follow, routing is based on losses and morale. This allows small units of elite troops to hold off masses of undisciplined barbarians.
Here are some basic points to understand about combat. Details will be discussed later on in this section.
● Units are deployed on the battlefield corresponding to the Army Setup screen under Position squads. ● The attacker is on the left, the defender on the right.
● Units move across the battlefield in accordance with the instructions in <set battle orders>
● When units move adjacent to an enemy, they halt due to a "zone of control"
● Once units are adjacent, they attack each other every turn.
● The chance of scoring a hit in melee depends on the difference between attack and defense values
● The chance of scoring a hit with missile weapons depends on the number of units in square the missile hits, and how good the target's shield is (if it has one).
● The chance of doing damage after scoring a hit depends on the attacker's strength and weapon damage versus the defender's protection.
● Magic in combat works a lot like missile weapons [see x]
● Morale is calculated for each squad. A squad takes a morale check when it suffers enough casualties. ● A squad routs when it fails a morale check.
● Battles are fought until one side routs off the map: the other side is said to have won the battle
● Troops will rout when all of their commanders have been killed or routed.
The entire army will rout when their side loses 75% of its total hit points
So if you kill or rout all of an army's commanders, the whole army will rout. It does not matter how big it is. The biggest army in the universe (of Dominions) will rout if it is led by a single commander, and he is killed or routed.
(For this reason, there is no "attack commanders" order. You will have to figure out how best to do this yourself!)
Battles View
When you get a report on a battle, you can click on the message “There was a battle in <province name>”. This gives you the battle summary with the casualty lists. Clicking the “View battle” text will take you into the battle replay.
The battles in Dominions are actually very detailed tactical resolutions fought at the level of the individual fighters, mages, and priests. Each unit has its own equipment and abilities. They move and fight according to these parameters, according to the battle sequence. When you watch the battle replay, you can see what happened with various degrees of detail. There is a box in the upper left which describes the action. You can change the level of detail in this box by hitting the number keys: [1] for least detail, [2] for more detail, and [3] for most detail.
Other useful keys when viewing battles are:
[Arrow] for scrolling around the map
[PageUp] [PageDown] for adjusting the camera height
[Space] for pausing the action
[c] for toggling colored squares for the teams
[g] for toggling grid
[w] for toggling the wire frame grid (battelfield graphics disappear from view)
[q] to quit out of the battle replay
[f] speed up battle replay to fast speed
[t] speed up battle replay to fastest speed

Note: There have been reports of incorrect battle replays, which is the result of a battle inconsistency bug, which causes the replay to become corrupt. This can lead to minor discrepancies in result or in outright incorrect victory. It is a very rare bug but is known.
Battle sequence
When combat is started, the attacker is placed on the left side of the screen and the defender on the right. All units are placed on the battlefield according to their setup. They will then proceed to follow whatever orders they have been given (attack, cast spells) until they rout or the battle ends.

ARMY SETUP
Units in Dominions 5 are placed into squads, which are under the leadership of a commander. A single commander can lead up to five squads.
The total number of units a commander can lead is designated by the Leadership rating found in the unit abilities. Clicking on this rating gives further details of the commander's leadership limits, such as how many magical being or undead may be led. This is important, as not all commanders have the skill to give orders to magic monsters. And undead and demons don't take orders from just anybody either.
Squad limits related to leadership values
Leadership 10: automatic -1 to morale for a single squad. An additional -1 to all squads for every squad beyond the first (so five squads = -1 base penalty and -4 for four extra squads = -5)
Leadership 40: No morale penalty if leading one or two squads. -1 penalty for every additonal sq. Leadership 80: +1 morale for all squads if three or fewer. -1 penalty to morale for every squad above three
Leadership 120: +2 morale for up to 4 squads, -1 penalty to all if fifth squad added Leadership 160: +3 morale for all five squads
The morale effects of leadership rating are based on the base leadership rating of the commander. Commanders gain more leadership with experience, so a highly experienced commander with a base leadership of 40 might be able to lead up to 85 units or more, but the morale bonuses still stay the same.
Other effects on morale:
Mixing undisciplined units with normal makes entire squad undisciplined and hits them with -1 morale Mixing undead with living gets a morale penalty of -1
Mixing demons with normal units gets a morale penalty of -1
Each unit is placed on the map in a grid square. A single grid square can hold a total of six size points of units. For human-sized units (size 2), this means three units can fit in a grid square.
Unassigned units (those in the garrison box at the top of the Army Setup screen) are formed into one large squad. They begin at the center of their side's army.

From the tomes of the lore of Dominions
Bandar Log is a very hierarchical society. Markatas are the smallest of the monkey people and their intellect is barely above that of simple beasts. Markatas are small, noisy, and annoying, especially when met in large numbers. If alone, they can be used as scouts, but when in greater nunbers, they quickly become bored and start to make noise and play with each other. They are generally despised by the larger monkeys and apes. They are sometimes given small bows. This pleases them no end, but they still are not very useful soldiers.

FORMATIONS
Formations are the patterns used to deploy units of a squad onto the map. There are five types of formations.
Types of formations
Box
A box formation deploys your units in as close to a square as possible. The 36 Infantry of Ulm (size 2) shown above are deployed in a box with four squares frontage and three squares deep, yielding 12 squares of three units each.
Line
A line formation deploys your units in a straight line facing the enemy.
Double line
A double line is the same as a line except half the units are placed in a rank immediately behind the first line.
Sparse line
A sparse line formation is identical to a line, except that an empty square is inserted between each square of units. This doubles the length of the line. It carries a -1 penalty to the squad's morale.
Skirmish
Skirmish formation forms a box-like checkerboard formation which separates each square of units from its neighbors with an empty square in four directions, as above. It has a -1 penalty to morale.
Undisciplined squads automatically use the skirmish formation and cannot use any other. Adding an undisciplined unit to a squad makes the whole squad undisciplined.
The ability Formation Fighter allows you to fit more units in a square.
Battlefield movement
Each unit in combat has combat speed. A move of one square on the battlefield costs roughly one point of combat speed, unless it is diagonal in which case it costs 50% more.
When units move adjacent to an enemy, they become locked in a “zone of control” which remains as long as the enemy persists.
Each unit moves individually, and has a cooldown at the end of each action. After a unit moves one step or strikes, it must cool down a while before it can perform its next action. A long cooldown is one round (after a strike) and a short cooldown comes after a move. There is some small amount of randomness to this cooldown value, but when moving it is mostly determined by the unit’s combat move, so faster units will wait a shorter time before taking the next action. If two units are adjacent, the unit that finishes its cooldown first will get to strike next.
MELEE COMBAT
Melee combat is the act of one combatant (soldier, priest, monster, or divine being) physically striking another combatant in some way. At its heart, it is very simple.
The attacker makes an attack roll. The defender makes a defense roll. These are compared. If the attack roll (with modifiers) is greater than the defense roll, it hits. If not, it misses.
The attack and defense rolls are modified by a random number (which is added) and a fatigue penalty (which is subtracted).
Attack roll: attacker's Attack attribute + DRN - Fatigue penalty Defense roll: defender's Defense value + DRN - Fatigue penalty
Once a hit is scored, a similar calculation is done to determine how much damage is done. This involves the attacker's damage roll minus the defender's protection roll.
Damage roll: attacker's Strength attribute + weapon Damage attribute + DRN
Protection roll: defender's Protection attribute + DRN (+ shield Protection if it is a "shield hit")
If the defender has a shield, the hit is a shield hit unless the attack beats the combined value of the target's defense and the shield's Parry value plus the random roll. If a hit is scored as a shield hit, the shield's Protection is added to the defender's protection roll.
Example: A Heavy Infantry unit has a broad sword, chain mail hauberk, half helmet and shield. It has a base defense of 10, gets a defense bonus of +1 from the sword, a defense penalty of -2 from the armor, and a defense penalty from the shield of -1. The shield's Parry value is 4. The actual defense is 10 +1 -2 -1 = 8. With the shield's Parry value, the unit's total defense is 12.
The Heavy Infantry is attacked by a Vanjarl of Vanheim, which has attack 14. Neither unit has any fatigue yet. The Vanjarl rolls a 6, for a total attack value of 20. If the Heavy Infantry rolls a 7 or less, it is a clean hit and the shield offers no protection. If the Heavy Infantry rolls an 8 through 11, the Vanjarl scores a shield hit and the Heavy Infantry can use its shield's protection value in the damage calculation. If the Heavy Infantry rolls a 12 or higher, the Vanjarl misses entirely.
The Protection value used is the target's listed Protection value, unless it is a head hit. In case of a headshot, the target's helmet Protection value is used instead of the main Protection value. However, if it is a shield hit, the shield Protection is still added. The blow is assumed to have glanced off the shield and hit the target in the head.
If the damage roll is greater than the protection roll, the difference is subtracted from the target's hit points. If the protection roll is equal to or greater than the damage roll, there is no effect.
Shield destruction
Shield hits can damage or destroy the shield. A shield has a Resistance, which is the same as its shield protection value, +5 if the shield is a magic one. The attack has a Break value, which is equal to the damage of the attack before any Protection.
If the Break value is >= 3x the Shield Resistance, the shield is damaged. If the Break value is >= 5x the Shield Resistance, the shield is broken.
An already-damaged shield which is damaged again has a 25% chance of being broken.
A damaged shield has -20% Protection, a broken shield has -50% Protection.
A magic shield (a real, equipable one) that is damaged will repair itself after the battle. If a magic shield is broken, it will be permanently destroyed and the commander will revert to his or her standard shield if he or she had one. Damaged or broken mundane shields will be repaired when they are in a province with enough spare production resources.
Hit locations
Dominions 5 uses anatomical locations to determine where an adversary was struck. An attack has a 50% chance of striking the adversary in the torso, 20% chance to strike the arms, 20% chance to strike the legs, and 10% chance to strike the head. Certain hits can cause afflictions, such as losing a limb. If someone loses a limb, it will be the one which was hit. This can be an arm, leg, or head. Losing your head is usually instant death, but this is not always true, for example in the case of undead and certain kinds of regenerating monsters, or those with multiple heads. Other types of afflictions include losing an eye, which can only happen on a head hit.
In order to score a hit on a certain part of the body, however, the attacker must be able to reach it. To score a head hit, attacker size + weapon length must be equal to target size. This requirement is one less to hit the torso and two less to hit the arms. Thus a human (size 2) wielding a mace (length 1) could hit a size-6 creature only in the legs!
Weapon types
Melee weapons in Dominions 5 come in three different types: slashing, piercing, and blunt. Each type has different effects when calculating damage. These are all calculated after the Damage vs. Protection calculation above, except for Piercing weapons which reduce Protection prior to the calculation.
Blunt weapons do 50% more damage when scoring head hits after the Protection value is deducted. They score 25% more damage toward shield destruction.
Slashing weapons do 25% more damage after Protection is deducted. They do 50% more damage toward shield destruction. If a slashing weapon scores a leg, arm, or head hit that costs a target greater than or equal to 50% of its hit points, that body part will be chopped off. If a head is chopped off, this will kill the target if it had a head that was required for it to stay alive. (For example, a hydra does not fit that description.) 
Piercing weapons reduce Protection by 20% prior to any calculation. This is the same mechanic as the Armor-Piercing ability, except that Armor-Piercing reduces Protection by 50%.
Two-handed weapons add 125% of Strength to damage.
Underwater effects: slashing and blunt weapons have an attack penalty equal to weapon length underwater, while piercing weapons do not. If a weapon does both piercing damage as well as another type, the underwater penalty is halved. Flails have an additional penalty of -1.
A weapon may be able to inflict more than one type of damage. If so, it has an equal chance of doing each type of damage, but will only do one of them during that attack. For example, the short sword does both slashing and piercing damage. It has a 50% chance of doing one of these. If it does not do piercing, it will do slashing, but never both.
Note that these weapon types apply to all sorts of weapons, not just maces, swords, and spears. A spider's venomous fangs can do piercing damage, for example.
In addition, weapons may have additional special effects, such as fire, cold, or magic.
Damage is displayed in red numbers above the unit that suffered the damage. This can be very helpful in determining the effectiveness of your units and tactics.
Harassed (replaces Multiple Attack Penalty in previous Dominions) Every time a unit is attacked, it gets a point of harassment penalty. Each point of harassment penalty reduces the unit’s defense by 1. It is then reduced continuously by a percentage, so it goes down quickly if it is high and the unit is no longer being attacked. Mounted units are only half as affected, requiring two attacks to suffer one point of harassment penalty.
A weapon with multiple attacks inflicts 1 point of harassment penalty for each one of its multiple attacks.
Fatigue
Fatigue is affected by a unit’s encumbrance value. The more encumbered it is, the more fatigued it will become during combat. Each time it attacks, it gains Fatigue equal to its current Encumbrance value. Fatigue affects units as follows.
Defense penalty for fatigue For each 10 points of fatigue (rounded down) a unit has its defense reduced by 1.
Attack penalty for fatigue For each 20 points of fatigue (rounded down) a unit has its attack reduced by 1.
Critical hit due to fatigue Each time a hit is scored, a DRN is made to check for a critical hit and the unit’s Fatigue / 15) is subtracted. If the DRN is less than 2, a critical hit is scored and the defender’s protection values are all reduced by 25%.
Unconsciousness A unit falls unconscious when it reaches 100 fatigue. Each turn it is unconscious it regains 5 fatigue until it become conscious again (i.e. fatigue drops below 100). A unit with 200 fatigue starts to take hit point damage from exhaustion instead of fatigue when additional fatigue damage is taken.
Note that it is very hard to score a critical hit on an unfatigued unit while a unit that has a fatigue of 60 will suffer a critical hit about one of every four times it takes a hit.
Repel Repel is how Dominions represents the effectiveness of long weapons, such as halberds, pikes, and the like. If a unit attacks an enemy who has a longer weapon than the attacker, the defender may actually repel the attack and prevent it from happening. This occurs as follows:
Any defender that has a longer weapon than the one used by its attacker makes a repel attack automatically upon being attacked. Attack and defense rolls are made. If the result is a hit, the attacker must pass a morale check or immediately abort his attack. If the attacker passes the morale check, he may make his attack, but the defender’s attack then generates damage and protection rolls. If damage is inflicted, the attacker takes one point of damage and finishes his attack.
This simulates the defender successfully placing his longer weapon between himself and the attacker. All of this occurs before the attacker’s strike is resolved. Note that units with low morale are more likely to be repelled, and thus using long weapons against low-morale troops is very effective. Also, units with claws and bites (weapon length zero) are easier to repel.
A unit gets -2 to its Repel roll for each time it has been attacked that turn. So it’s easier to repel the first attack than the second, and so on.
Multiple attacks Some units have multiple attacks. This may be due to multiple weapons, or just multiple methods of attack like biting, clawing, or many tentacles.
Multiple weapons Attackers with multiple weapons have their attack skill reduced by the sum of their weapon lengths. Thus, it is much easier to fight with two daggers than with two swords. The Ambidextrous ability reduces this penalty by the amount of the Ambidextrous skill. Some weapons are considered intrinsic to a unit and do not cause multiple weapon penalties for the attacker. These are called bonus weapons. For example, the charioteers of Arcoscephale have both a spear and a shortsword, but because the spear is a bonus weapon (different from a normal spear) because it is wielded by the second man on the chariot while the driver fights with a short sword.
MISSILE COMBAT
Missile combat is different from melee combat in that it doesn’t use defense values. Instead, the game determines which square a missile hits, depending on a unit’s Precision, and the range of the attack. If there are units in the square, they may be hit, whether they are friendly or enemy. Missiles can’t distinguish friend from foe.
If the range from attacker to target is greater than Precision/2 – 2 (half the Precision, minus 2) then the missile will deviate from the target. The amount of deviation is equal to the range x 1.25 / Precision.
The game will randomly determine whether the missiles deviate long or short, left or right, or some combination. The actual distribution is a bell curve – most projectiles will fall within the middle of the deviation range, but some will land at the extremes.
Once the game decides where a missile lands (even if it is far away, that square is affected), there is a hit calculation that uses the following values:
Attacker: DRN + (Size points in the square) +2 if magic weapon Defender: 2 + DRN + (shield parry value x2) – (Fatigue / 20)
If the attacker’s roll is greater than the defender’s then a hit is achieved. Damage is calculated identically to melee combat (see above). Most missile weapons add one-third of the unit’s Strength to the weapon damage value (plus a random number). Crossbows and some other weapons are armor- piercing, meaning that only half of the defender’s Protection value is used. Some spells can even be “armor-negating,” which means that armor affords no protection. Lightning spells are armor-negating. Fire spells are armor-piercing.
Precision values greater than 10 count double for the amount above 10. Thus, a Precision value of 12 is actually calculated as Precision 14.
Thus, the more units in a square, or the bigger the units in a square, and the more tired they are, the more likely someone is going to be hit by a missile weapon landing in that square.
While it may seem that missile units can’t shoot very far without having their shots deviate hopelessly, in practice massed units can deal severe damage to an enemy simply due to the number of projectiles in the air. Everything that goes up has to come down somewhere!
Note: Unlike in Dominions 3, missiles can now cause shield hits. Previously all missiles were deflected if they hit the shield, but now the shield is simply treated as Protection, just like in melee combat.
SPECIAL DAMAGE
Some types of damage can cause the target to sustain additional damage. Others inflict their damage gradually, or increase fatigue instead of reducing hit points. These include fire, cold, poison, fatigue, paralysis, and drain.
Some units are not as susceptible to certain kinds of damage. In Dominions, this is represented by the concept of resistances. If a unit is resistant to fire damage, for example it is said to have fire resistance. This works identically to protection. It is like armor against fire. The standard resistance is 15, which will reduce damage as though it had extra protection of this number.
Elemental resistances give double protection against those attacks of that type which cause fatigue damage. So Shock Resistance 5 would reduce fatigue effects from thunder by 10. Shock Resistance 15 would thus give protection of 30 from a Thunder Strike.
Fire damage
Fire is generally armor-piercing, which means that a unit only gains half its normal benefit from Protection. In addition, a unit may catch fire, which will subject it to additional burning damage until the fire goes out.
A unit that is burning takes 1d(size) damage each turn until the fire goes out (a die with a number of sides equal to the size of the unit, so for a Size 6 unit it would be 1d6). The chance of the fire going out is
25% + (fire resistance x2) + (cold scale x5) +100% if it is raining. All fire have a minimum 1% chance of being extinguished.
If the province has heat scales instead, this is treated as negative cold.
Cold vulnerability counts as negative cold resistance. Units with 5 or more cold resistance, units with heat auras, and ethereal units will never freeze.
Cold damage
A unit suffering cold damage may freeze. It will then take additional fatigue damage until it thaws.
A unit that is freezing takes 2d6 additional fatigue points of fatigue damage each turn until it thaws. The chance of thawing is
25% + (cold resistance x5) + (heat scale x6) + (cold resistance)
Cold vulnerability counts as negative cold resistance. Units with 5 or more cold resistance, units with
heat auras, and ethereal units will never freeze.
Cold scales work like heat scales for burning: if it’s cold in the province, the chance of thawing is reduced by the scales.
Profuse bleeding
A unit suffering from profuse bleeding suffers 10 fatigue and takes HP/20 damage each round. The chance of bleeding stopping is 10% + (regeneration value) and is divided by 2 if unit is underwater.
Poison damage
Poison works differently than fire or cold. If a unit takes poison damage, that damage will be suffered over multiple rounds, which is the amount of time it takes the poison to have its effect. This damage is spread out as evenly as possible. First, a total amount of damage taken is calculated, just like with any attack. Then, each combat round, a unit will take 10% of the remaining damage.
So if a unit takes 15 points of poison damage, it will take 2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 points of damage (each number is in one round). In the first three rounds it will take 2 points per round, and in the last seven rounds it will take 1 point per round. The first turn the unit takes 10% of 15, or 2 points, and now 13 remain. The next turn it takes another 2, and another 2 on the third turn. That leaves 9 points, and 10% of that is 1, for the remaining 9 turns.
Poison resistance has no effect on the duration of damage. Once the poison has taken hold, there is no additional benefit to poison resistance. It is useful only in reducing the total amount of damage initially.
Shock damage
Shock damage can Stun a target.
Chance for Stun = 5% + (percentage of hit points lost from this hit) / 2 Stun prevents the affected unit from taking any action for one round.
Life Drain damage
Life Drain damage is not extra damage, but instead is a way for the attacker to restore his or her hit points and fatigue by damaging an enemy. Once damage has been calculated (if the target is a living unit), the attacker with life drain:
Increases his hit points with damage / 2 Reduces his fatigue by damage x 2
Weapons with partial life drain are less potent, and only the first 5 points of damage dealt are treated as drain. The remainder are considered normal damage only.
Life Drain cannot increase a unit’s hit points above 150% of its maximum hit points +10.
Lifeless units only take 25% damage (after Protection).
Acid damage
Acid damage can inflict Rust. It has the same chance as fire. Only units with iron weapons or iron armor can be affected by Rust.
Rust
Rusty armor can be damaged if it takes a hit in combat.
Chance for Rusty armor to be damaged = damage inflicted (before armor protection, but after shield protection) * 2%
Rusty weapons have a 25% chance of being damaged when they inflict a hit on something. Damaged weapons have their damage reduced by 2, except for blunt weapons which have their damage reduced by 1.
Paralysis damage
Paralysis is a type of damage based in part on the victim’s size. It, as you might have guessed, paralyzes the target. The number of combat rounds the paralysis lasts (the duration) is determined by the number of paralysis points done.
Duration = (Damage – victim's Size) / 2
If that is all the paralysis damage taken, then the target is only paralyzed for that many rounds. However, if the target takes additional paralysis damage, a new duration is calculated, and the target takes half as many points of damage as the lesser of the new or old durations. In other words
If already paralyzed, Damage = (minimum of old and new duration) / 2 This damage can never exceed 5 points.
The new duration will be the greater of old and new duration (not cumulative), so if the new attack has a longer duration, the target will be paralyzed longer.
Fatigue damage
Fatigue damage adds to a unit’s fatigue rather than subtracting from its hit points. Units fall unconscious when they reach 100 fatigue. No unit can have more than 200 fatigue – each 25 fatigue points inflicted once a unit has reach 200 inflicts 1 point of hit point damage. If fewer than 25 fatigue points are inflicted, the chance of taking 1 hit point of damage is (the number of fatigue points inflicted x 4)% except that a single fatigue point will never result in any damage.
MORALE AND ROUT
Morale Morale is a measure of how likely a squad is to keep fighting after taking casualties. Each unit has a morale value, but the morale value that is checked is the morale level of the entire squad. Each squad has a morale level, which is the average of all the morale ratings of the members of the squad.
Morale bonuses A unit can have a number of modifiers to its morale. For example, Sacred units can be blessed, which increases their morale by 1, and spells like Sermon of Courage (+1) and Song of Bravery (+1) can increase morale also. In addition, all units can gain the following bonuses:
+1 for fighting in friendly dominion
+1 for fighting in a unit’s home province (the province where it was recruited)
+x for a commander's leadership bonus (click on Leadership attribute) This is further modified by the formation in which the unit is fighting, how many squads the commander is leading, etc.
+1 for every level of the Inspirational ability the squad's commander has (can also be negative)
+x if there is a unit with the Standard ability in the squad, where x is the bonus from highest Standard
Rout During combat, squads will have their members killed and wounded, and eventually they will take flight from the field. This is called routing, and happens to the entire squad.
Rout is checked by squad. A squad which fails its morale check routs. A squad will check morale if:
● The squad has suffered “heavy losses” since the last morale check, and its overall casualties are at least 20%
● The squad has four or fewer units left in it and at least one of the units has taken damage this round ● The squad is near a monster causing Fear (e.g. an Abomination)
● The squad has been subjected to a spell causing Fear (e.g. Terror)
● The entire army has taken 50% or more of its total hit point value in casualties. In this case, morale will be checked every turn for the remainder of the battle. Retinues are excluded from this "greater than 50% of army hit points" if there is nothing more than one creature and its retinue. This is a special case.
“Heavy losses” is one wound for every two members of the squad. A “wound” is simply 1 or more hit points of damage that reduces a unit to 80% or less of its normal hit points. So a unit with 25 hit points that is undamaged and suffers 4 points of damage does not count as having suffered a “wound” for these purposes. The next point of damage, however, will reduce him to 80% of normal, and every hit there after (even if for 1 point) will continue to satisfy these criteria. Units are very enthusiastic at the beginning of battle, but less so after taking damage.
No matter how many times the above conditions are satisfied, a squad cannot have its morale checked more than once a turn.
Army rout Once an army has taken 75% of its total hit point value in casualties in a battle, it will automatically rout.
Morale check A morale check consists of two numbers, the morale roll and the fear roll. If the fear roll is greater than the morale roll, the squad routs. If not, the squad keeps fighting. Although it is called the “fear roll,” it applied to anything that checks morale, not just fear.
Morale roll: squad morale + DRN + survivor bonus Fear roll: 13 + DRN
The survivor bonus ranges from 0-5, depending on how many of the squad’s original members are still alive. The smaller the proportion of survivors, the smaller the bonus. An intact (or almost intact) squad will get a bonus of 5. A squad that has been almost wiped out gets no bonus.
Rout effects A routed unit will use all of its action points each turn to move towards its own side of the battlefield and off the friendly edge.
A routing unit suffers a -4 penalty to its defense skill. Fast units can be very effective at picking off enemy units that are routing, as they have better chance of catching them before they exit the map.
Once a routing unit reaches the map edge, it is safe, and on the turn after the battle will appear in a province adjacent to the battle (see Retreat rules on page [80]). If a unit retreats to an enemy province, it is destroyed. A routed army may scatter to multiple provinces after a battle, requiring a commander to go collect it. Routed units suffering from profuse bleeding, poison, burning, decay or other special damage will have the remainder of that damage applied once they get off the map edge and may not survive. This represents the unit successfully fleeing the battle but expiring of its wounds before finding help.
Units in a victorious army can rout off the map as well, since a squad can rout while others are winning the battle. If the battle ends before the routing units exit the map, at the end of the battle they remain with the victorious army. If they rout off the map before the battle ends, they scatter to adjacent provinces.
Mindless units Mindless units need to be under the control of a commander. If there are no unrouted commanders on the battlefield eligible to command mindless units, remaining mindless units on the field are automatically subject to mindless dissolution.
If all eligible commanders (i.e. commanders who can command mindless units) have been killed or routed, the mindless beings become immobile and have a 33% chance each turn of dissolving and vanishing from the battle. They will not move, but will attack adjacent units.
Magic beings and undead These units have special leadership requirements, such as magical leadership or undead leadership. If such units are on the battlefield without proper leadership, they will rout. If a unit is both an undead and a magic being (such as the manikins of Asphodel), it requires undead leadership to lead. Demons require undead leadership to lead.
AFFLICTIONS
Whenever a unit is struck in battle, it may suffer an affliction. The chance of this occurring is simply the % hit points lost in the blow. So if a normal 10HP soldier receives two 4HP blows, he would have a 40% chance and then another 40% chance of getting an affliction. What type of affliction is suffered depends on which part of the body was struck.
There are major afflictions and minor afflictions. The chance of an affliction being major is affliction chance / 1.5, or at most 33%. Where the hit occurs determines which kind of afflictions may be inflicted. The game will randomize from all afflictions available for that level (major or minor) and that body part.
     Body Part Minor Affliction Major Affliction
     Any Battle Fright Profuse Bleeding
Head Eye Loss Mute
Chest Chest Wound Never-Healing Wound
Arm Weakened Leg Limp
none
Dementia Feeblemindedness Blindness
Diseased
Lost an arm Crippled
                           Profuse Bleeding is the only affliction that is not permanent: it will disappear during or after the battle. While a unit bleeds, it loses 5% of its hit points and gains 10 fatigue per round of combat. The bleeding has a 10% chance of stopping per round. Being underwater halves this chance and regeneration increases it.
Limp will cause commanders to suffer a -4 map movement penalty. Non-commander units do not lose any map movement points, but whenever their army marches more than one province in a month, they will have a 25% chance of dying.
Cripple will cause commanders to lose 75% of their map movement speed. Non-commander units do not lose any map movement points, but whenever their army marches, they will have a 50% chance of dying, or a 75% chance of dying if marching more than one province.
BESIEGING FORTRESSES
Fortresses must be reduced before they can be stormed. To reduce a fortress, its Defense value must be reduced to zero. Each turn, the total reduction strength of the besiegers is compared to the total repair strength of the defenders.
Reduction strength = unit strength squared ● Flying units are doubled
Repair strength = unit strength squared / 2
● Flying units are doubled
● Mindless units are only worth 1/8th of calculated value ● Animals (not monkeys!) are halved
● Undisciplined units are halved
The difference is subtracted from the fortress defense value if the Reduction strength is greater. If the fortress has been damaged, and the repair strength is greater, the difference is added back to the defense value, to the maximum of the original value.
That's why you get the message sometimes when you're the besieger, that "the enemy is repairing the walls faster than we can destroy them. We need more men." This means the repair value is higher than the reduction value, and the besieged units are actually fixing the walls. There is no way for the besieger to know exactly how close a fortress is to being breached (although you will get hints). The defender, however, can click on the fortification location button in that province, and the current defense value will be displayed. Fortresses which are damaged but not besieged are automatically fully repaired.
Supply during sieges
When a fortress is besieged, it provides its supply value to the defenders, divided by the number of turns of the siege. So on the first turn of a siege, a fortress with 300 supply provides 300 supply points on the first turn of the siege, then 150, then 100, then 75, then 60. Units which are unsupplied suffer the starvation effect, and units which starve for two consecutive turns can become diseased. These diseases will then spread inside the fortress!
RETREATS
If units retreat from a battle, they will go to an adjacent province, or perhaps a friendly castle in the same province. To do this, a commander must be smart. Each commander will undergo a check and has a 75% chance of making a “smart” retreat. (If a unit is in native terrain, it will get a second chance to be smart at 50% if it fails its first check.
A smart leader will:
● Retreat into a fort in the same province if there is one
● Move to a random friendly-controlled adjacent province if no fort is present
A not-so-smart leader will:
● move into a random adjacent province, even if not friendly controlled.
Troops will follow a leader under whose command they are when they retreat, if they pass a morale check. The squad morale bonus counts double for this, undisciplined units suffer a -3 penalty, and the squad morale penalty for skirmish formation also applies.
Troops that have lost their leader or who fail a check to follow their leader will individually check for being smart or not (with only a 50% chance of success, although the 50% second chance for natives still applies) and then retreat accordingly.
A unit or commander that retreats to an enemy province is killed.
BATTLE SUMMARY
 When battle results are reported, you can see the relative effectiveness of the units present by seeing which units were responsible for the most kills. The will of course be affected by your tactics, formations, and magic. The summary will show you how many units started the battle, how many kills they scored, and how many of them were killed by the enemy.

From the tomes of the lore of Dominions
The Nazcans are mainly descendants of the Raptor clan. When civil war broke out in Caelum, Nazca broke free and a Raptorian kingdom was formed under the rule of the last Eagle King. But soon society was divided into two parts: the Hanan moiety and the less-numerous dark-winged Hurin moiety. The Aucac Runa are professional soldiers of the Sun Kingdom. The Aucac Runa of the Hana moiety traditionally use short hand weapons such a maces and hatchets. When the first Eagle Kings arrived in what would become Nazca, iron working was still unknown. The Aucac Runa mostly use armors and weapons of cloth and bronze. Stone maces are bronze hatchets are the most common weapons. The Caelian tribes have intermingled in Nazca, and most Nazcans have some resistance to cold.
