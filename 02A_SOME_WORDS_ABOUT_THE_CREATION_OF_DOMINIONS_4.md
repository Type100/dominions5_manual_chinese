After completing Dominions 3 we were a bit tired of making Dominions, so starting with Dominions 5 then was out of the question. Also, Johan got a new full-time job at Sony Ericsson then and got his programming needs fulfilled there. Many Dominions 3 patches and a long break later we got inspiration for making a new game again, but we wanted something different from our earlier projects. So we started with Trade & Taint.
Trade & Taint was just a preliminary name, but we never figured out a better one. It was a real time multiplayer online game, like a MMORPG, but not massive and with no 3d characters. The game took a lot of inspiration from Star Sonata, a great little game by the way.
The concept was to buy a party of soldiers and donkeys and then transport goods between villages, making money by buying cheap and selling were the demand was high. After a while you would be rich enough to start your own colonies and create mines there if the place is mineral-rich or maybe plant fields and sell oats. It was still an Illwinter game, so we had magic and horrors, too. When you had a colony you could create a wizard's tower and have your mages perform magic rituals, craft items, and enchant your surroundings. We had global rituals too, like meteor storms that made a meteor crash down on the world every minute or so. The meteor storms looked very apocalyptic and were devastating for everyone but the horrors. Performing magic made the world more tainted and enough taint resulted in horrors appearing. First came a few, then came some more, and finally there was an apocalypse of horrors that destroyed settlements, player colonies, and eventually the entire world.
It was, however, a bit too ambitious and it felt impossible to finish, so it got laid aside. Instead, we decided to make something easier and that was to create a modern Conquest of Elysium, because we have always enjoyed that little game. And now we had some cool horrors from Trade and Taint to put into Conquest of Elysium as well.
After Conquest of Elysium 3 was finished, working on Dominions sounded like a fun idea again, so we started to plan a Dominions 4. We had a few really major changes that we wanted to see: one was the 3D world map from Trade and Taint. Here you would get line of sight for armies and movement speed would be meters per day with exact distances between cities. Also, you would have changing terrain and line-of-sight for magic rituals. Another idea was real-time battles, with everyone moving at once and spells having different casting times. The third idea was team play with a team consisting of one god and his disciples.
Then we made a list of all the little changes we also wanted to make and it got very long. So long that we thought it was enough with that list to make a new game. So we scrapped some of the major ideas that had the potential of making Dominions 4 a worse game than its predecessor. Thus, we decided against the 3D map and the real-time battles. We have experienced a few games that got worse with their updates and we didn't want that with Dominions 4. Maybe with a Dominions 5. We kept the team play idea though, because it fits well with the current Dominions system. Also we really enjoyed the team play in the War of the Ring board game and wanted the same feeling in Dominions. For those who haven't played it, there are fixed teams: Sauron and his ally Saruman on one side, and all the good ones on the other.
When development of Dominions 4 started, the GUI system from CoE3 was imported. Then the network system, random map generation and some 3D stuff from Trade & Taint was imported too. Sprites were imported from both games, so we got some new horrors and new item pictures from Trade & Taint, where there are sprites for every mundane weapon and piece of armor in the game. Some monsters like the gelatinous cube from CoE3 were also imported. In an effort to get the sprites sorted in a more logical way as well as redrawing the ugly ones, Kristoffer decided to rearrange all the sprites in the game. So for a long time almost all nations had what looked like random sprites for its units, making it somewhat difficult to play.
Our first test game took place right after we got the team play working. Many units still looked funny and you had to tell Kristoffer that "my scout looks like an elephant with a red cross on it," to have him prioritize that.
During development a multitude of new ideas popped up. Some were small and easy to implement, others had more impact on the game. The Thrones of Ascension was one such later development that we just had to add, once we came up with the idea. Some ideas were discarded and others lie around and might be added in future patches.
Now, a bare month before release and almost 3000 posts in our beta forum, the game is working well, random sprites are quite rare and bugs tend to be easy to fix.
We hope that you find Dominions 5 entertaining, regardless of whether you are new to the series or if you are a long-time player of our games.
