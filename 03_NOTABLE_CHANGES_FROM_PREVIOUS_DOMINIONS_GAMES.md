After four separate iterations of Dominions, it is amazing how many things we truly didn’t know about how things were back in those days. The realities of research into a long-ago, mystical world with creatures and forces unlike anything we are familiar with in the current age lead to surprise after surprise. Just in this latest edition of Dominions, we have been forced to alter the mechanics to reflect the following realities:
● Movement in Dominions was terrain- and cost-based, and weather not inconsequential. Units with similar capabilities moved in similar ways. Light infantry were of similar speed, heavy infantry slower, and there were even slower and faster fliers. Some units had the ability to survive in certain terrain that made them move faster through special knowledge. Of course, moving in enemy territory or in bad weather was slower. But this all came from the discovery that in some cases, units could move more than one province at a time, even in enemy territory!
● Arcane learning was not only long and arduous, but all-consuming. We previously thought that it was possible for mages to research a little in one school and a little in another school. This has been shown to be false. A mage can only research one school at a time, as its singular mysteries consume all his or her thought. No longer can mages split their research between multiple schools in one turn.
● The roads in Dominions were not constructed by its inhabitants. It does not appear that any of the roads described in the chronicles were actually built during the time those chronicles were written. Roads began and ended with the creation of the world, through mystical forces. You can no longer build road improvements in Dominions 5.
● The soldiers of Dominions were in the main city-dwellers. Recruitment in Dominions was very much based in the cities or heavily populated areas, judging from many newly discovered texts such as diaries and ape-scribblings. Centers of population were much more important in real life than previously thought, so expect them to be so in your game.
● Weapons and armor interactions were even more sophisticated than we thought. If you thought that you understood exactly how different types of maces, flails, daggers, spears, clubs, tridents, and halberds interacted with chain, plate, ring, scale, leather, or other mails, you should read this section anew to improve your knowledge..
● Some commanders were indeed crafty. The old stories of commanders who were lost due to an inability to retreat, thus leading to the loss of their troops, were somewhat misleading. They often retreated to a castle or other refuge, or at least to friendly lands. If they were natives of the territory this was almost certain. But the less crafty ones were likely to be lost.
● Architecture in Dominions was not as advanced as once thought. Fort building now always starts with the simplest type of fort (usually palisades) and must be upgraded later. Building an advanced fort from scratch is the sole province of magic!
● Religion was in some ways as elemental as magic. Priests have some spells that depend on the type of god they worship, whether it be fire, air, death, or what have you. This suggests that in the world of Dominions, magic and religion were not as far apart as you might think!
● Battles were fought in real time. In previous versions of Dominions, we saw armies move one at a time, in our concept of “turns.” It turns out (ha!) that this was a modern accommodation. In fact, when you watch battle replays, you will see each side moving at the same time, as it truly was when those battles were fought in those times.
● Beware the Cataclysm. In previous versions, games could end on victory points. This is no longer the case. Instead, based on the Cataclysm that destroyed the Ermorian Empire through the unleashing of Death itself, a game can be set to end after a set number of turns. After this set point, horrors will descend and start destroying Thrones of Ascension. Every Throne destroyed also reduces the number of Ascension points required, so a winner should appear shortly after the Cataclysm begins. Who wins in the event that no one owns a Throne? The horrors do.
But one of the most interesting new discoveries is that there were far more bless effects and combinations thereof than was ever imagined by even the most controversial and revisionist of Dominions scholars – the type who made all sorts of wild claims just to cause trouble. In this case, it seems that the gods truly were diverse and multiple in capability and craft. Your pretenders will be, too. But for some bless effects, the pretender needs to be present to truly impart his or her or its energy. Because in the world of Dominions, nothing is ever just quite as we thought it was. Which is the whole point.

A short note from the writer of the manual: I got involved in the Dominions series when Dominions 2 was released. I saw that some people would like more of an explanation of what was going on in the game, and how to access its many features and elements of world-building that had been baked into the game but were in some cases rather inscrutable. Since that time, many things have changed, notable among which is the fact that future versions have become more and more accessible with tooltips and other interface improvements that alleviate some of the need for a voluminous manual. Other things have changed as well, such as the ubiquity of the Internet, increases in bandwidth, and the shift of the culture from the old days of thick, spiral-bound manuals to the lively present day of Let’s Play videos. Manuals can still be helpful, though, as a place to explore the breadth of a game, get specific answers to basic questions, and reassure new players that there are concrete concepts undergirding the rules. However, with the takeover of video presentation in gaming, Dominions 5 has joined in by shifting to a series of introductory videos rather than a printed tutorial. If you click on the Tools & Manuals button in the opening screen, you will find a series of excellent videos by DasTactic linked under the Manuals & Introduction Videos button. We hope you enjoy them, and that they succeed in making your entry into the world of Dominions as smooth and enjoyable as possible.
