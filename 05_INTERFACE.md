STARTING A GAME
Game creation and game playing in Dominions 5 are separate things. In order to start a new game, you must create it under Create World. When you return to a game you have already created after the first time you play it, you choose Continue Old Game.
Creating a pretender is an involved process (see The Pretender) but once you have done so, your pretender for that nation is stored and available for new games. The game will store multiple pretenders for each nation, and the order in which you created them corresponds to the order (top to bottom) in which they appear when you get to the Load Pretender God screen.
Note: Pretenders created “on-the-fly” in the Create World process are not saved. They function for that game only. The only way to save a pretender build for later use is to go through the Game Tools from the main menu and choose Create Pretender God. That will create a pretender and save it to the /dominions5/savedgames/newlords folder. So if you have a good idea while whipping up a pretender during game creation, remember it or write it down and then go back and make it using Game Tools!
To create a new game, click on Create World in the opening menu screen. You'll be asked to choose a map, which can be a pre-made map or a randomly created one. The map will be generated once you have made all your choices for the game. The next step is to give the game a name. This generates a folder with this name in saved games folder so you can find the files easily. You can access this from the Tools & Manuals menu under Other → Open User Data Directory.
You can start playing the game immediately from the creation menu, which makes it faster than the system in previous Dominions games. Once a game has been created and you have quit out of it for some reason, you
 can play it again by choosing Continue Old Game from the same menu, and selecting the appropriate one.
Choosing an Age
The next choice will be whether to play in the Early, Middle, or Late Ages. This determines the
nations available. In general, Early Age nations have weaker troops and stronger mages.
Choosing participants
Once you have selected an age, you can select the nation you and the AI player(s) will represent. The default is “Random” which will choose from the available list of nations. You can choose a specific nation by clicking on the word “Random” which will open a window listing the available nations for that Age. Then click on the nation you desire. Nations cannot be duplicated – there can only be one of each in a given game. You can also set the AI players to specific nations in the same way. To add another player (either AI or human), click on “Add new player.” To remove a player from the game, click on the name of the nation (or on “Random” if you have not set a nation) and click on the word “None” at the bottom of the list of nations.
Once you have selected your nation and the other nations (random or otherwise), you need to either create a pretender or choose one from your available pretenders. If you have already created a pretender for a nation, you can access it via Load Pretender God at the bottom of the pretender creation screen. If not, you can create a pretender right there.
Disciple games
At the bottom of the Choose Participants screen is a checkbox for "Disciple Game." This is a special type of game that will be explained below. Once you check this box, two additional columns will appear: one for Team and one for pretender/disciple. You will not be able to click "Ok" (the choice will be greyed out) until each team has one and only one pretender (and any number of disciples). There is no requirement for balance among teams, or equal numbers of disciples, or having disciples at all. You can change teams and pretender/disciple status by clicking directly on the team number, or on the word "pretender" or "disciple."
The disciple game is a team game which allows players to play in teams, but preserves the true nature of the world of Dominions, which is that it is all about pretenders aspiring to godhood. And there can only be one god in the end. So one player takes on the role of the pretender. All other players on his team (if there are any – there is no requirement for all pretenders in a disciple game to have disciples) play the part of his disciples.
Disciples do not create pretenders, they create disciples. A player has 300 points (rather than the usual 425 for pretenders) to create a disciple. Furthermore, disciples have no dominion or scales. They only choose physical form and magic paths. They also cannot choose whether they are awake or not from the beginning of the game. They awaken in half the time of the pretender God, so only awake gods start with awake disciples. After all, it is they who are heralding the entrance of the pretender god. The temples of disciple players spread the dominion of their pretender god. The disciple unit itself does so, too, but as a prophet (the equivalent of one temple check). Disciple units also get increases in strength, hit points, and magic resistance when they are in their pretender god's dominion, just like prophets. In disciple games, no one can appoint prophets, neither the pretender player or the disciple players, since the disciples act as prophets. Prophets can only be appointed in standard, free-for-all games.
Game settings
The last issue is the game settings. These control the makeup of the world, as well as some options for renaming commanders, showing score graphs, and various other options. The options are straightforward and are described by tooltips that appear when mousing over the different categories. Players can choose to make gold more or less available, change the frequency with which magic sites will appear, adjust the strength of independents, and many other things which will give the game a unique character. This is largely up to the players’ taste. For example, a game with a high independent strength will slow players’ expansion while they build larger armies to conquer adjacent provinces, and will prolong the time before enemy nations come into contact. Increasing magic (either sites or research) will hurt nations which have weak magic to begin with, because more magic-oriented nations will be able to start using more powerful magic faster. You’ll eventually get a feel for what works for you.
Score graphs Score graphs contain a lot of information, and can take over a multiplayer game as everyone watches who has the most provinces, who has the biggest army, and thus who is seen as the biggest threat. It makes for a very different game if players have to scout for information, and diplomacy becomes more useful since it’s not immediately obvious that you have an army twice as big as your neighbor’s. The game plays very differently in multiplayer with score graphs on, as the prime objective becomes to not be the leader in any of the major categories, while not falling too far behind, either.
On the other hand, in solo games, especially for newbies, the score graphs can be valuable tools for gauging your progress and evaluating threats to your position. Use them wisely.
Units with the Spy ability give players access to score graphs, even if they are disabled. They cannot get information on enemy players unless they are in the enemy capital, however.
Master password Setting a master password allows the host to go in and set a player’s position to computer control (and thus preserve the flow of the game) if a player drops out and his pretender is password-protected. For large multiplayer games where some attrition is likely, consider either setting a master password, or having a third party collect all the passwords for the game, to be used only if a player becomes unreachable. While the usefulness of the master password is mostly the ability to give AI control to a dropped player, it does allow full access to a player’s position.
The game supports hotseat play (multiple players on the same computer), play-by-email (PBEM), or online play (either over a LAN or the Internet). If you are the only human player in the game (all other nations are AI) then it is a solo game and you can skip the descriptions of PBEM, hotseat, and network play below.
Victory Conditions There are a number of different victory conditions than can be set for the game. The most straightforward one, of course, is to conquer everyone else. But you can also win by research, by dominion, or by controlling Thrones of Ascension. You can mouse over the victory conditions to see which ones suit you. Thrones of Ascension is the default victory condition.
Cataclysm This is a way to force the game to end after a certain number of turns. The Cataclysm will cause horrors to appear and start destroying Thrones of Ascension. (These are powerful horrors.) Every Throne destroyed also reduces the number of Ascension points required, so a winner should appear shortly after the Cataclysm begins. In the unlikely event that no one owns a Throne as the last ones are destroyed, the horrors win.
Playing a PBEM game
Because turns in Dominions 5 are resolved simultaneously, it works well in PBEM (play by email) because turns don’t have to be passed around sequentially from play to player. All it needs is a player to be the “host” and collect turns from all the players. He then resolves the turns and sends the results to each player.
Starting a PBEM game is very similar to starting a solo game. It can include AI-controlled nations as well. All that is required is that players create their pretenders using the Create a Pretender God tool, and send the resulting file to the host player. This file is located in the /newlords folder which resides inside the aforementioned /savedgames folder. For example, the first pretender you created for Early Age Marverni will be named early_marverni_0.2h. Subsequent pretenders will be named early_marverni_1.2h and so on, sequentially. This corresponds to the order (top to bottom) in which they appear when you get to the Load Pretender God screen. So if you have five pretender gods for a given nation, the fifth god you created will be the bottom one on the list. Make sure you send the host the pretender file you want to play with, and tell him the name of the pretender to confirm it!
Note that the host does not actually have to be a player in the game.
Creating a PBEM game Once the host has received all of the players’ pretender files, he or she must place them in his own /savedgames/newlords folder. If he or she has similarly named files for pretenders he or she created for his or her own adventures in the world of Dominions, he or she must make sure to move them or otherwise not overwrite them. Then the host creates a game just as though he were creating a solo game, by choosing a map, naming the game, and selecting the appropriate Age as described above. The host then sets all of the nations and chooses human or AI control as appropriate
in the Choose Participants screen. When this is done, the host must Load a Pretender God for each human player in the game. The host will be prompted for each nation that is not controlled by AI. He can then proceed to create the rest of the game normally.
Preparing for PBEM Once the host has created the game, he needs to make sure every player has the appropriate map. If you are using one of the included pre-made maps, there is no need to distribute the map as everyone should have it. Because Dominions 5 can generate random maps, this means a host who generated a new map for a game will have to distribute the map files to everyone, since this map is unique. There are two such files, with the following naming convention: __randommap_[gamename].map and __randommap_[gamename].rgb. So if you choose to name your game “Kalevala” for some reason, the map files will be __randommap_Kalevala.map and __randommap_Kalevala.rgb. All participants, including the host, should place the relevant .map and .rgb files in the /dominions5/maps folder.
Likewise, if you have downloaded a map from one of the map artists in the Dominions community because you like it, you should make sure everyone has downloaded the map (and has agreed to play on it). Just like random maps, the relevant .map and .rgb files should be placed in the /dominions4/maps folder. That is where Dominions 5 goes to look for maps.
Finally, all players need to create a folder in /dominions4/savedgames with the name of the game created by the host. All turn files will be placed here, and all orders generated by players will be saved here.
Hosting a PBEM game After this is done, all the host needs to do each turn is send the appropriate .trn file to each player. This file will be named the same way the pretender file was named, but it will be found in the game folder, not /newlords. For example, if a player is playing Early Age Niefelheim in the Akalabeth game, the appropriate file to send to him or her is early_niefelheim.trn, which will be located in the /savedgames/akalabeth folder. On the first turn, the host just sends these files out to everyone.
On subsequent turns, the host will need to collect orders from each player in the form of .2h files (see below), load the game, and hit the Host button.
Playing in a PBEM game Playing in a PBEM game is simple. A player receives the .trn file from the host via email, places it in the folder on his computer with the appropriate game name, selects Play an Existing Game from the main menu, chooses that game name, and does the turn. When finished, the game will generate a .2h file with the nation’s orders. The player just sends this back to the host.
The Hosting Function When the host has all the .2h files he needs, he loads the game using Play an Existing Game. To advance the turn, he or she selects Host from the screen showing all the nations. A nation which has current valid orders will have a checkmark in front of the name in the nation list. AI nations never appear on this list – only those nations under human control will show up. If the host is playing, he shouldn’t forget to do his own turn! If he or she is playing on the hosting computer, he or she will not have to transfer his own files – they are saved in the right place automatically.
The PBEM sequence is summarized below:
1. The players send the appropriate pretender file to the host. This file is found in /savedgames/newlords. The host places these files in his /savedgames/newlords folder, taking care not to overwrite any of his own, if applicable.
2. Host creates game, making sure to set nation control to “human” for each nation that will be controlled by a player. AI nations can also be included.
3. All players ensure that they have the correct map files in their /maps folder. (Only necessary if playing on random or user-made maps.) The actual truth here is that players (as opposed to the host) only need the .rgb file – the .map file is just for game creation. Once the game has started, all of the .map information is incorporated into the ftherlnd file. But it’s good to have both files, because you’ll need them if you ever want to play your own game on that map.
4. The host sends each player the appropriate .trn file, which is found in the appropriately named game folder in /savedgames, and will have the nation’s name in the filename.
5. Players put this .trn file in the appropriate folder in /savedgames, load the game using Play an Exiting Game, and perform their turns. The turn can be saved and exited as many times as necessary. Once complete, players find the .2h (not the .trn!) in the game folder and send it back to the host. Remember: .2h = 2 the host!
6. The host collects the .2h files, puts them in the game folder, selects Play an Existing Game, checks to make sure he has all the turns (there will be checkmarks next to the names of all player nations with valid orders) and hits Host. He then goes to step 4 above, and steps 4-6 are repeated for the rest of the game.
Hosts send .trn files. Players send back .2h files. It’s that simple. The host will always need the ftherlnd file, but it is never sent to anyone. Note that the player files are the .2h files in the /savedgames folder of the appropriate name. In the above example, files for the game “Akalabeth” would be in the /savedgames/akalabeth folder. The .2h files in /newlords are only for pretender loading at game creation. They have the same file extension but are not the same in fact.
Stale turns If not all nations have submitted orders for a turn, the host can still host the turn. If the host goes ahead before all nations have submitted orders, the nations missing their turns will generate a “stale turn” report. This is how you know if you missed your turn.
Turning a player to AI control Sometimes players drop out of games, but the rest wish to continue. If the player who is dropping out does so voluntarily, he can set himself to AI control by selecting the Options screen once he is actually in the game (during the turn) and choosing Become computer controlled. This will allow the AI to take over, and the host will no longer need to receive files from him or her (apart from this final .2h file, which needs to be sent to the host with the orders to go to computer control). This choice wipes out any orders for that turn – the computer will do the whole turn on its own.
However, sometimes players just vanish. If this happens, the host can manually load the player’s turn and set it to computer control using the hosting computer. If the player in question has password- protected his pretender and the host does not know the password, he can use the Master Password if the game was set up to use one.
If not, and the host decides to host through it, the dropped player’s position will hold, generating stale turns. No orders will be issued, so units will not move, there will be no recruitment, etc. The only things that will happen will be automatic events, like gem accumulation. Because it is easy to roll over a nation when you know his or her armies will be stationary, this is something that needs to be agreed upon by all players, since the dropped nation’s neighbors will likely benefit disproportionately.
Once the computer has taken control of a player position, it cannot be reversed.
Patches Throughout the history of Dominions, the developers have regularly issued patches to fix bugs, add features, and make balance adjustments. There is no reason to believe this will not continue with Dominions 5. Usually, the new version can load files from the old version, but not vice versa. The way to manage this in PBEM games is to have the host patch when he has all the turns and is ready to host. So when a patch comes out, all players should first complete their current turns with the old version and send their .2h files to the host. Then the host should apply the patch, and then host the game. Players should then apply the patch to their own machines before loading the .trn file they get back from the host, which will be using the new version.
Hotseat games
Hotseat games are run simply as PBEM games where no files are sent – players just sit down at the same computer and do their turns sequentially. To start your turn as a given nation, click on that nation’s name. When everyone is done, click on “Host” and the new turn will be generated. No fair peeking over people’s shoulders.
Playing a network game
Dominions 5 can also be run over a network (TCP/IP or LAN) using a server. This requires someone to run the game continuously on a computer where the players can log in and access their turns. The server computer acts as a host, and can be automated to host the game at regular intervals. Alternately, the owner of the host computer can simply select Host manually each turn. There can be someone (even multiple people) playing on the host computer, or it can just run the game. A single machine can host multiple games, as long as each one is on a separate port.
Creating a network game To play Dominions 5 over a network, the host machine must first create the game, just as in PBEM. This is done from the Network selection in the main menu. Choose Setup Dominions server, and choose a port. The port does not matter as long as it is reachable on the host’s machine. The lowest possible port number (1024) often works well.
The host chooses the Age normally, and then a screen will appear with all of the available nations showing. In order to claim a nation, a player will need to connect to the game using the Connect to Dominions server selection from the Network choice in the main menu. The game will ask for an IP address (or server name, such as dominions4.server.com) and port, which the host must provide to the players. Clicking on the text “Open” next to a nation will claim that nation. The player will then load a pretender that he has created previously from the game tools menu.
The host will have the ability to set nations to AI control (by clicking on the text next to the nation to cycle through choices).
You can connect to a hosted game using the same computer that is doing the hosting. Just open another instance of the Dominions 5 application and join normally. Thus, the host machine can be used to play as well. The hosting instance of the application must always be running, though.
Note that because the network connection is (ultimately, even when using server names) to an IP address, a computer with a dynamic IP on a DSL or cable modem connection that has its address frequently renewed may become unreachable if players are not informed of the new IP address when it changes. Likewise, if the hosting computer is behind a firewall, the host will have to open the appropriate port (chosen above) so it can be directed to the host machine. Because there are so many possible configurations, players should be familiar with their networking setups to ensure that the port the game is using can be passed back and forth through any firewall. Only the port chosen in the Setup Dominions server screen needs to be forwarded – nothing else.
The three most common reasons for a player not being able to connect to a server game are (1) There is a firewall/routing problem on one end or the other; (2) The player and the server are running different versions (someone didn’t patch!), and; (3) the host computer is down.
Game Tools
Dominions 5 has a number of options under this menu to create new pretenders, as well as manage pretenders you have already created. There is also a map editor, a tool for creating random maps with custom settings, as well as a shortcut to the directory where Dominions 5 stores your files. There is also a tutorial. The tutorial in Dominions 5 is a video, made by DasTactic. You can watch along and learn many of the secrets of Dominions by clicking the Manuals & Introduction Videos button.

From the tomes of the lore of Dominions
Ermor is an empire centered around a great city. For centuries it has grown, and has become more and more influential. Traders and travelers from near and far come to the city. By military campaigns, diplomacy, and trade, Ermor has become a power to be reckoned with. By adopting local traditions and beliefs, Ermorians posed little threat to neighbors and conquered peoples, but this has begun to change. A new God is rising. Old syncretistic faiths and spirit worship were banned by a Prophet dressed in white shrouds. The remnants of his bods and shrouds are buried in the Holy City of Eldregate where the adherents of the New Faith are awaiting the arrival of the Reawakening God foreseen by the Prophet. The all-encompassing old state cult of the Numinas still survives, but the Pontifices and Flamen are slowing adopting the New Faith.
PLAYING THE GAME
Once you have started a game and are presented with the main game screen, you'll need to become familiar with the interface. The most important thing to remember about this system is that
in order to select a province, you must right-click on it. However, to select anything else, you left-click.
● To select a commander, left-click on his icon and he turns white (selected).
● To give a commander order to move, you left-click the province to which you want him to move. ● To select a unit in the Army Setup screen, left-click on it.
Thus, left-clicking works for selection in most other screens, but not the main map screen. The popular strategy game convention of "left-click to select, right-click to set destination" doesn't apply here. Right-clicking, in many cases, gives you further information. For example:
● To get information on a unit in almost any screen, you right-click on the unit.
The most common consequence of this inversion is that players may give a unit an order to move, and then while the unit is still selected, left-click on a faraway province in order to select it. Because left- clicking is used to specify a unit's destination, and the faraway province you clicked on is an invalid destination for the leader that you (still) have selected, the leader you just moved defaults to Defend. If you don't notice this, your commander that you think has been ordered to move will just sit there. Another common error is to not notice that a stealthy commander is commanding all stealthy units, and thus instead of moving, they end up sneaking (and not attacking). See Stealthy Units below for more information. Stealthy units can be ordered to move normally by holding down [Ctrl] while selecting their destination.
BASIC GAME FUNCTIONS
To the right of the map screen is a panel of buttons that forms the main game interface. These are divided up into four sections. The Game buttons control global game functions, like ending the turn, quitting, changing settings, or reading the game messages for that turn. The Magic buttons are not magic themselves, but simply give you access to the game's magic system. These do not depend on which province you have selected. Depending on which province you have selected, some of these buttons may be inactive. For example, you cannot recruit units in a province you do not own, so clicking on this button while such a province is selected does nothing.
You can hide The Game, Magic, and Province (units) buttons by hitting the “h” key. The location buttons will always be displayed.
Some buttons may be active (like the Statistics button) but not yield any information if the score graphs have been turned off in the game options when the game was created.
The Province (location) buttons refer only to the locations in the province you have selected. There may be none showing if the province you have selected has nothing to display, or if you simply don't know about it. If you own a province with a temple, clicking on that button will yield additional information. If it is another player's temple, the button will be inactive. You may also find information on magic sites, or simply the fact that they exist (but nothing further). The laboratory button is always inactive and only indicates that a lab has been built in the province.
Most of these buttons will be discussed in detail in further sections. All have hotkeys listed here in [brackets]. The basic functions are:
End Turn [e] When you have completed your turn, this button saves your move to a file in the game folder, or uploads it to the server if you are playing an online game. You may still go back and adjust your move, or even start over from scratch. Exception: In a solo game, hitting End Turn automatically hosts the current turn. This is not like Dominions II – do not hit End Turn in a solo game as a way of saving your orders!
Options [Esc] Adjusts music and video settings, and allows you to save, and quit the game.
Map filters [1-5,8,9 keys] Toggles map displays of armies, national flags, temples, fortresses, etc. Statistics
[F1] Nation Overview This screen gives a global picture of your units and provinces. You can buy province defense, or go straight to a province using this screen. It also keeps track of magic site searches.
[F2] Score graphs If score graphs are enabled, you can see a running comparison of the strengths of the various nations in terms of provinces owned, total dominion, army size, etc. You can also see the names and status (human or AI) of all pretenders, and whether or not they are still in the game.
[F3] Hall of Fame Commanders who have survived the most fight and killed the most enemies receive Heroic Ability for entering the Hall of Fame. This ability continues to improve as long as the hero is listed here.
[F4] Pretenders Displays a list of pretenders in the game the game unless all information on other players is disabled.
Messages Allows you to read [m] beginning-of-turn messages, and send [s] messages, items, or gold to other players.
[F5] Research Takes you to the Research screen where you can access spell research.
[F6] Global Enchantments Shows you the global enchantment spells currently affecting the world.
[F7] Magic resources This takes you to the magic resource treasury where you can see your magic gems and gem income, and transfer gems between commanders.
[F8] Magic item treasury Shows the magic items you have found or forged.
[F9] Display thrones This is not a button but just a general shortcut. It displays the Thrones of
Ascension active in the game (if any).
[t] Army setup This is where you can assign your units to commanders, change formations, and array your forces on the battlefield. See Army Setup on page [49] for more information
[b] Mercenaries Players can see which mercenaries are available for hire. You can bid on these by clicking on the name of the company you wish to bid on.
[r] Recruit unit This opens the recruitment panel for a given nation and shows the units available for recruitment in the selected province. This only works for provinces the player controls.
The remaining buttons will be described in their appropriate sections.
THE MAP
Maps in Dominions 5 have one characteristic feature: they are divided up into provinces. These provinces are delineated by the brown lines. However, the lines are really only for your visual reference; the game engine does not use them in any way. Instead, what is important is which province is a neighbor of which other province. You can see this by hitting the [8] key to Toggle Neighbors.
      Some provinces are separated from one another by a heavy brown or red line, usually in the mountains. This designates an impassable border, and two provinces that are joined solely by such a border are not neighbors. On some maps there is simply an absence of a border. To confirm this you can select one of the provinces and hit the [8] key as above. The chart on the next page shows all the display toggles.
Provinces are designated by both a name and a number. You may not know the name of a province if you don't have any way of getting intelligence on it (like a nearby friendly province or scout), but you will always know the number. While some special provinces may have fixed names, most are randomized at the start of the game. However, for a given map, the province number will be constant; province (12) on the Aran map will always be in the same place in every game.
All game mechanics in Dominions 5 are based on provinces. Movement is done from province to province. Units are recruited on a province-by-province basis. Each province has a number of attributes that govern its contribution to the game.
Province attributes
When a province is selected, you can see its attributes in a box in the upper left corner of the screen, provided that you have some way of gaining this information (either through scouts or the proximity of friendly provinces). If you don't have any way to gather this information, all you'll get is the map number of the province. You'll always be able to tell which type of terrain a province has, even if it is on the opposite side of the map. Most information about a province will be unavailable unless you actually own it (it is friendly to you, displaying your national flag).
If you have dominion over a province, you will be able to see its income and name, even if you do not control it. Once you have scouted a province, the province name is remembered and you can always see it even if you do not have friendly units in it. For more information about how much information you will receive on any given province, see Scouting and Scrying on page [33].
The province attributes shown in the main province screen break down as follows:
Terrain Terrain is shown in the lower left of the province info box. It is very important to determining how valuable that province will be in terms of income, resources, supply, and magic sites. Farmland tends to have high population (and therefore income) but low resources and few magic sites. Mountains tend to be just the opposite. Mountains, forests, swamps, caves and especially wastes are more likely to contain magic sites. Terrain also allows or restricts multi-province movement. See the section on Movement.

There is a major distinction between land and underwater provinces. Underwater provinces cannot be entered by units without a special ability that allows it (such as amphibian, aquatic, or water- breathing), they do not contribute resources to fortresses on land and cannot be crossed by flying units. Units with sailing may cross water provinces, but may not remain there at the end of a turn.
Population Population determines income, and is affected by many factors: Growth/Death scales, patrolling, dominion, pillaging, and random events. The population in a province sets the base income from that province: Income base = Population / 100.
Income A province contributes its income rating to the owner's treasury every turn. Income accumulates in the treasury. The number shown is after all modifications. Income is determined by multiple factors, including population, dominion scales, fortress administration, and unrest.
The basic formula is Modified Income = (Population / 100) * (dominion scale modifiers) * (1 + fort administration / 200).
If the province has unrest, this number is Final Income = Modified Income / (1 + (unrest * 0.02). If a province cannot trace an unbroken line of friendly provinces back to a friendly fort, it does not
produce income that turn. Taxation requires communication.
Note: Speaking of taxation, note that while the process of income collection is referred to as taxation here, there is no explicit "taxation" mechanism or button in the game. This is a change from previous Dominions games, where you could set the level of taxation in each individual province. This is no longer the case. Taxation back then was not so easy.
Resources The resource value of a province, representing raw materials needed to make weapons and armor. Resources are reduced by unrest, like income. Resources are collected by forts from neighboring provinces. A province only produces half of its potential resources for use in that province unless it contains a fort. The number shown is the number actually being produced, not the potential.
Note that in the capsule screen, resources are displayed as hammers. As a province’s resources are allocated to recruitment, the hammers in the capsule screen are progressively greyed out.
Resource availability in a province is reduced by unrest according to the formula Resource % = 100 / (100 + unrest)
Thus, an unrest level of 100 means a province produces only one half of its normal resources. Furthermore, no units may be recruited in a province with an unrest level of 100 or greater.
Building a fort in a province greatly increases the number of resources available there.
Recruitment Recruitment is a new concept in Dominions 5. This represents the ability of populated areas to concentrate the resources necessary to recruit and equip forces. Recruitment points depend on the population present in a province, as follows:
The recruitment bonus for forts is then applied (e.g. +50% for palisades). Order scales also affect recruitment points by +10% per step.
Dominion This represents the religious dominance being exerted into that province. Only one pretender can have dominion in a given province. If it is positive, the dominion is yours and is represented by a white candle. Negative dominion is someone else's dominion, and is represented by a black candle.
Capsule screen The income, resources, and dominion in a province can be displayed (and toggled off) by hitting the [5] key. The hammers (resources) and standards (recruitment) become progressively greyed out as the player allocates them for production during a turn. Turning on the capsule screen can be a good way of scanning to see if there are any provinces with underallocated resources or production.
Unrest Unrest represents turmoil in a province and reduces both income and resources there. Unrest can be raised by random events, enemy spies, blood hunting, magic sites, certain targeted spells, or global enchantments. Unrest can be reduced by patrolling, province defense, Order scales, magic sites or random events. Unrest also affects the chances of capturing blood slaves, or of successfully finding stealthy units by patrolling.

From the tomes of the lore of Dominions
The Deives of the Sun is a giant of divine heritage, once given the splendor of the Sun by a previous Pantokrator. Every morning, she rose and brought warmth, comfort, and fertility to frozen lands. So great were her powers and so great her mercy that mankind turned away from the Pantokrator and gave her their prayers instead. Furious, he stripped her of authority and imprisoned her. But now, with the Pantokrator gone, her prison is crumbling and the Deives can reclaim her lost authority and bring the warmth and comfort of the Sun to mankind once more.
   Population Recruitment Points
0-5,000 10+pop/100
5,000-10,000 10+50+(pop-5000)/200 10,000+ 10+50+25+(pop-10000)/400
Supplies The supply rating of a province determines how many units the province can support. If more units occupy a province than can be supplied by the indicated supply rating, starvation occurs. Units consume different amounts of supply based on their physical size (see Units for more information on this). The supply rating in a province is determined by multiple factors.
Population-based supply is calculated from the population present in a province, modified by the Growth/Death and Heat/Cold scales. The first 10,000 population in a province generates supplies at 1 supply point per 100 population. Additional population generates 1 supply point per 200 population. This is modified by the Growth/Death scales (first) and the Heat/Cold scales (second) to arrive at a Population-Based Supply number.
Fortress-based supply depends on the province's proximity to a fortress. If the province in question is within four provinces of a fort, fortress-based supply is added to the population-based supply calculated above. This depends on the fortress' Admin rating (see section on fortresses below) and uses the formula (Administration * 4) / (Distance + 1). Only the highest fortress-based supply is used if there is more than one nearby fortress.
       Example: A province with 20,000 population has Growth 1 and Heat 3 dominions in it. It generates 400 supply points for the first 10,000 population, and 200 supply points for the remaining 10,000 population for a total of 600 supply. Supplies are increased by 20% for the Growth 1 dominion, increasing the total to 720. The Heat 3 dominion, however, reduces this amount by 30%, or 180 supply points, for a population-based supply of 540.
The province is also three provinces away from a Castle (Admin 30) which has had 10 points of Admin added to it through upgrades, resulting in an Admin rating of 40. This generates an additional 40 supply points. The province has a final supply value of 540 + 40 = 580.
                    Supply Usage The number of supplies being used by the units currently occupying a province is shown under Supply Usage. If there are not enough supplies in a province to supply all of the units currently occupying that province, starvation may occur.
Defense Defense indicates the level of provincial defense present in a province. Raising provincial defense costs an amount of gold equivalent to the new level purchased. (Thus, level 1 costs 1 gold, going from level 1 to level 2 costs 2 gold, going from level 10 to level 11 costs 11 gold, and so on.) Additional benefits are gained at levels 1, 10, 15 and 20. Provincial defense costs no upkeep, and is fully restored after a battle if the owner does not lose control of the province.
Provincial defense levels can be raised by clicking on the word Defense in the main province screen. Shortcut key [d]. Provincial defense levels cannot be voluntarily reduced. However, it takes at least 10 population to support each point of province defense. Province defense will be automatically reduced to a level which can be supported by the population of the province.
Corpses The number of unburied corpses in a province. This is important for some spells (Raven Feast) and for raising undead. You can only see this information if you have a death mage or an undead priest in the province. If the nation's normal priests can reanimate undead (a special property of certain nations), they can see the number of corpses, too.
Dominion scales Dominion scales are separate from dominion, although the two are related (see chapter on Dominion for more specific information). The level of dominion scales in a province is shown by icons/text in the main province window.

Much of this information can also be seen in the Nation Overview screen [F1], which will also show commanders and their locations. You can set defense and give orders in this screen, as well as use it to go directly to a province in the main map. This makes it quite useful. New players should get their [F1] fingers in shape. The specific finger used to access this screen may or may not be important.
National summary
  Regardless of which province is selected, the national summary will appear next to the province info. The treasury lists the total amount of money your nation has. Total income is the income prior to paying upkeep costs, which are shown in parentheses. In the right-hand corner is a symbol denoting the season. If you mouse over this it will tell you the exact season in the game.
Upkeep All units in the game (except for most summoned units) cost upkeep each turn equal to their gold cost divided by 15. Sacred units cost half as much upkeep (gold cost divided by 30).
Magic gem inventory Your gem inventory’s contents are displayed in the national summary, and you can go directly to the inventory screen by clicking on any of the gem icons.
FORTS
Forts are structures which exist on the map and can be upgraded. Forts serve as collection points for resources, supply depots for distribution to surrounding provinces, and shelter for troops in the event of a siege. Each fortress type has different attributes.
Admin The admin value of a fort determines the percentage of resources from neighboring provinces that the fortress can collect. It also propagates supply into nearby provinces. The formula for this is (Administration x 4) / (Distance + 1). Thus, a fortress with admin 50 contributes 100 supply to adjacent provinces. Four provinces is the maximum distance for this supply
propagation.
Administration also increases the income of a province by Admin / 2%. Thus, a fort with an Admin value of 30 would increase the income by 15% of any province in which it is built.
Defense The defense value of a fort represents the number of points of damage
that must be done to a fort by an enemy siege before it can be attacked. Each
turn a comparison is made between the strength of the sieging and besieged
forces at a fortress. The difference between these forces determines the amount of damage done to the fortress' defense value.
Supply The supply value of a fortress determines only how many units can be supplied inside that fortress in the event of a siege. It does not affect the distribution of supply to surrounding provinces. Each turn a fortress is under siege, its supply value is divided by the length of the siege to determine the supply points available on that turn to the besieged units. Thus, on the fifth turn of a siege of a fortress with a supply value of 100, the fortress provides besieged units with 20 supply.
 
Distance
Supply
0 400%
1 200%
2 133%
3 100%
4 80%
Fortress statistics
  The statistics for each fort are listed when you click on the Fortification button in the province interface (also the [f] key). Some forts give bonuses to Commander Points and/or Recruitment Points.
Forts also have defense that functions as Province Defense when the fort is attacked. The current defense value of the fort against sieges is listed
 TEMPLES
Temples are the second of the three buildings you can construct in Dominions 5. Temples help you spread your dominion, either by directly inducing dominion spread [Exception: Mictlan, Early and Late Eras] or by providing a location for blood sacrifices (which are only available to certain nations – see the Dominion chapter). Temples also give priests a bonus when preaching.
A temple can only be built in a friendly province. If an enemy takes control of a province with another nation’s temple in it, the temple is immediately razed. If there was a temple in a province you captured, the razing will be reported in the turn’s events, along with the capture. Only one temple can exist in a province at a time. Temples cost 400 gold to build, although there are exceptions. Pangeaea and Marverni only pay half this cost for a temple, while Gath pays double.
Clicking on the Temple button on the lower right of the screen tells you how much dominion you spread each turn and how likely it is to be successful. This is broken down into the number of spread chances per month. Each temple can spread dominion, as can the pretender, prophet, and nation's home province. All of this is explained in detail in the Dominion chapter.
LABORATORIES
Laboratories (or labs) are the last building type available. Labs serve as magic gem collection points and centers of research. They allow mages in that province to perform the Research order, enable transfer of gems from the national inventory, and allow the casting of ritual spells. For a detailed description of these game elements, see Magic. Ritual spells can only be cast in a province with a laboratory.
MAGIC SITES
Magic sites are not buildings per se (although there are some sites which are buildings, such as the Firbolg Fortress and Jervellan Wall) but rather locations within a province that possess some special attribute, like magic gem production, unique unit recruitment, or other benefits. A province may have multiple magic sites, (max 8), not all of which may be visible at once. Magic sites are more likely to be found in mountain, forest, swamp, waste and cave provinces than in those with farmland or plains. Magic sites do not necessarily appear when you capture a province. Instead, the sites must be discovered by searching. There are four levels of difficulty. A mage must have skill in the magic path of the site equal to the difficulty level of the site in order to find it when using the Search for Magic Sites order. Thus, a level 3 Nature mage will find any difficulty 1, 2 or 3 sites in a province when he/she searches, but will not find a difficulty 4 site. When searching, level 4 in a path is the highest level ever required to find a site. There are spells which will automatically reveal all sites of a given path in a province (for example, Haruspex reveals all Nature magic sites), or even all magic sites, period (Acashic Knowledge).
Some sites (like the Void Gate) allow certain types of units to enter them for certain benefits. Entering such sites is a movement order available to eligible commanders.
Sites which permit the recruitment of national units (such as the Forest of Avalon) only grant this ability to that nation (in this example, Man). Enemy players who capture such a site will still collect the magic gems produced by it (if any) but will not be able to recruit the special units.
There is no guarantee that a site will be usable to a player when found. A Cave may allow a Blood mage to recruit demons, but if the player has no Blood mages, he will not be able to use it.
A magic site may have some additional requirement before it becomes useful. For example, the Library allows the recruitment of sages, but not until you build a laboratory. The role-playing reasons for this should be obvious.
Not all magic sites have beneficial effects. Some are sources of chaos, death, or other negative powers. These may cause unrest or other ill effects, and will happen whether or not the magic site causing the trouble has been discovered.
PROVINCE DEFENSE
Province defense (PD) is a way of protecting a province without actually stationing an army there. Defense is purchased at a cost of whatever the new defense level will be. So to buy the first level of province defense costs 1 gold, while the tenth costs 10 (and to get to 10, you have to buy the intervening levels as well, so ultimately a PD of 10 costs 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 = 55).
At defense level 1, a nation gets a commander and some troops. Each level of defense thereafter gives you more troops, which are shown as you increase your province defense. The maximum level of province defense is 100. At level 20 you get additional types of commanders and troops.
Every 10 points of province defense reduce unrest by 1 point in that province per turn. So 53 points of province defense would result is a recurring unrest reduction of 5 each turn.
Starting at level 15, province defense will have a chance of detecting stealthy units in that province. Each point of province defense above 15 gains one point of patrolling strength, so that a PD level of 25 has a patrol strength of 11. This is about the same as an equivalent number of patrolling infantry units.
A province can only support provincial defense if it has sufficient population. For every point of province defense, there must be 10 points of population. If this is not the case, province defense will be reduced accordingly at the end of the turn. This is the only way in which province defense can be reduced, other than having the province be captured, which wipes out all existing province defense, or relinquished (in disciple games), which reduces provincial defense by 25%. Once you have built province defense, you cannot reduce it in future turns. The down arrow does not work then.
UNREST
Unrest represents people being unhappy with the ruler of the province. This can be the result of many different unhappiness-generating events: a difference between the nation which controls the province and the one that exerts dominion over it will do it, since the people worship one god but are ruled by another. Blood hunting will definitely do it – imagine how happy you would be if someone came through your village and rounded up a bunch of young virgins for a blood sacrifice. Enemy spies and bards can do it because that is their job. Random events such as ill omens can cause unrest to increase. You should consider whether an ill omen would make you uneasy as well.
Unrest reduces the amount of income and resources a province generates. A province with unrest of 100 or greater will not permit the recruitment of new units. Thus, you can shut down an opponent’s production by destabilizing his or her provinces.
MERCENARIES
Mercenaries are units who are willing to fight for gold. They sell their services to the highest bidder. They are hired for a period of three months (turns). Clicking on the Mercenaries button will display the mercenaries available for hire, as well as currently hired mercenaries, their employer (indicated by the national flag) and the time of service remaining. When a mercenary band’s contract runs out, it will again become available for hire, except on that turn only, the previous employer’s bid counts double. It is only good for that turn, and if the mercenaries are hired by someone else, the bonus is lost and instead that nation will gain the bonus when those mercenaries complete their contract.

From the tomes of the lore of Dominions
C’tis is a swampy river valley surrounded by sandy deserts. In the fertile valley, a sacral kingdom of lizard- like humanoids has formed. The kingdom is ancient by human standards and its wisdom and magical knowledge is great. At the top of the society is the Lizard King and his Royal Heirs. The king is the highest priest of C’tis. Under the king are the High Priests with their sacred serpents, and the enigmatic Sauromancers, great mages of death and rebirth. The lizards are herbivores, but have enslaved a race of carnivorous lizardmen who serve as soldiers and workers. The C’tissians are somewhat slow in movement, but have thick hides that protect them from cuts and bruises, Both lizard races are cold-blooded and become exhausted very quickly when fighting in cold provinces. They have partial resistance to poison. The inhabitants of C’tis prefer to live in warm provinces.

SCOUTING AND SCRYING
Players will not necessarily have any information about a province besides what it depicted on the actual map. There are many ways to gather information about provinces, and these methods differ in what information is learned.
 Scout in province:
 Reveals owner, military info, fort construction, history.
 Reveals name and temperature of current and neighboring provinces
 Priest in province:
 As scout + dominion strength and dominion owner
 Spy in province:
 As scout + income, supplies, magic sites, unrest, province defense level and more accurate military info
 than an ordinary scout
 Dominion in province:
 Reveals owner, income, temperature
 Reveals dominion strength of neighboring provinces
 Scrying a province:
 Reveals name, owner, very accurate military info, income, supplies, magic sites, province defense level,
 history, temperature, dominion strength, dominion owner, fort constructions, unrest
 Owning a province:
 Reveals everything about the province.
 Reveals name for provinces 1-3 steps away. Early era only reveals names of neighboring provinces,
 middle era reveals name of provinces two steps away, late era reveals the names of provinces three steps
 away.
 Reveals owner, unreliable military info and temperature for neighboring provinces.

From the tomes of the lore of Dominions
During the subjugation of C’tis, lizard soldiers were recruited into the Ermorian ranks. Lizard Auxiliares have since been a regular part of the Ermorian army. The lizards are armed as Hastati, but wear ring mail cuirass of C’tissian design, and use round shields instead of the tower shields standard to the Imperial Legions.
